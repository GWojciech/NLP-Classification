0	@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
0	@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
0	@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
2	@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)

2	@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
0	@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
1	@united even on inteational flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
0	@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
1	@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.

2	@united thanks
2	@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
1	@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
0	@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
0	@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service

0	@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
0	@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
0	@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&C. #Flyingainteasy
0	@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting inteational flight! It seems so easy, but...
0	@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
0	@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
0	@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
1	@united that's right- with an oveight Miami.
1	@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim & recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
1	@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations
1	@united i DMed you the details
0	@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
1	"@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was ""Inop"". I love a good abbreve."
2	@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
0	@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0	@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
0	@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
1	@united thanks again for your conce. I will contact customer care upon our retu from Australia.
0	@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
2	"@united ""Airport snow removal method #22...""Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU"
0	@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a conce, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
0	@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
0	@united When will email address/useame sign-on be available? It's been a while.
2	@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
0	@united rude rude
0	@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover & I am stuck outside sec
0	@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
0	@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
0	@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
0	@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
0	@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
0	@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
1	@united 6533 ORD to DCA
0	"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
0	@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
0	@united I will not be flying you again
0	@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
1	@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
1	@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
2	@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
0	@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
0	"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
0	@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
0	@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
0	@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
0	@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
0	@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
0	@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
0	@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
0	@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
2	@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat.
1	@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
0	@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
0	@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
0	@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
0	@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
0	@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
0	@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
0	@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
2	@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
1	@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
2	@united thx for update
1	@united thank you !
1	@united dm these nuts
0	@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
0	@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
0	@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
0	@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!

1	@united Thank you.
0	@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my retu ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
1	@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
0	@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.

0	@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
0	@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
0	@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
0	@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
1	@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
0	@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
0	@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
1	@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
1	@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey
0	@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
1	@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
0	@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
0	@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
0	@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking patte of repeated neglect and disrespect.
0	@united Fingers crossed & its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
0	@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
0	@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
0	@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
0	@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
0	.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
1	@united please be good to me this weekend!
0	@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
0	@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
0	@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
1	@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
0	@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an inteational reputation for having problems.
1	@united yall should probably work on that.
0	@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
0	@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0	@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
0	@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
1	@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
0	@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now

0	@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
1	@united DM does not work what do I do?
2	@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again

0	@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
0	@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
0	@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
0	@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
1	.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
2	@united has unrivalled access to #Califoia with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
1	@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
0	@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
0	@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?

2	@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
0	@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
0	@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
0	@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
2	@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
0	@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0	@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
1	@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
0	@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
0	@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
1	@united Okay thank you
1	@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
0	@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service & was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
0	@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
2	@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
0	@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
0	@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
0	@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
0	@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
0	@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
0	@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
2	@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
0	@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
0	@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
1	@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
0	@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
2	@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
2	@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
2	@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
0	@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
1	@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
0	@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation & his original case back!
0	@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
0	@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
0	@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
0	@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
0	@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my retu flight.
1	@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
0	@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
0	@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
2	@united you are one great airline ❤️
0	@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Retuing home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
0	@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
0	@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
1	@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
0	@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
0	@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
1	@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
1	@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
0	@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
2	“@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN” We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
0	@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
0	@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
1	@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
0	@united plus what about food? And taxis?
0	@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
0	@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
0	@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
1	@united yes I do.
0	@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
0	@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
0	@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
0	"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
2	@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
0	@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
1	@united Deep Vein thrombosis
0	@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
0	@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
0	Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
0	@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call & hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
0	@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
1	@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
0	“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
1	@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
0	"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
1	@united DM sent
0	@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
0	@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
2	@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
0	@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
2	@united But thanks for asking
0	@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
0	@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
0	@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades & charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
0	@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
1	@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
2	@united you too!
2	@united is my favorite airline.
0	@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
1	@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
0	@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
0	@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
1	@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
1	@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
0	@united why would they make me share a room?
0	@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
0	@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
0	@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
0	@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
1	@united i understand, thanks
0	@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
0	@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
0	@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
0	@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
2	@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
0	@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and oveight Cancelled Flightations it seems like

0	@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
0	"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
0	@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys lea?
1	@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.
2	@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
0	@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
1	@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
1	@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
0	@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
0	@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
1	@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
1	@united I hope so too
0	@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
0	@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off & left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
0	@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
0	@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
1	@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel pattes enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
0	@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0	@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
0	@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
1	@united where is my flight voucher?
0	@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
0	@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
0	@united yes I filed a claim & hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep & no reimbursement.
0	@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
0	@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
0	@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
0	@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&J sandwich.
0	@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
0	@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
0	@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
2	@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
2	@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
2	@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
0	@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
0	@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
0	@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
0	@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
0	@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
0	@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
0	@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
2	@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
0	@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time & 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
0	@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
2	@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
0	@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
0	@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
0	@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
0	@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
0	@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
0	@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
1	@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
2	@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while..
0	@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
1	@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
0	@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
0	@united comically on the retu flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
0	@united GRK13575M is the file reference
0	@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
0	@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
0	@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
0	@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
1	@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
0	@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
0	@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
2	@united thank you.

1	@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
0	@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
0	“@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what's the point of membership?
0	@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
0	@united Dmed you. Thank you
2	@united thanks we'll be in touch!
2	@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
0	@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
1	@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?
1	@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
1	@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
2	@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
0	@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.

2	@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dos.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
0	@united where's my damn bag??
0	@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
1	@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
1	@united how is Mexico not inteational from the us?
0	@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
0	@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
0	@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
0	@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
0	@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
0	@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
1	Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
0	@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
1	@United so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for oveight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
0	@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
2	@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
0	@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
0	@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
0	@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
0	@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
1	@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ✈️
0	@united So you are inadequate by accident?
2	@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver Inteational Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
2	@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
0	@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
0	@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
0	@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
0	@united ...and when that doesn't work...
1	@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now
0	@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Ea miles but can't use them.
0	@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
0	@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
1	@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
1	@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️
0	@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
1	@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow moing.
0	@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
0	@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
1	@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
0	@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
2	@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
0	@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow moing because all the flights are overbooked.
0	@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
0	@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
0	@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
0	"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
0	@united Exhausted & frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
0	@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
2	@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a retu ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
0	@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0	@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0	@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
0	@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
0	@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
0	@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
2	@united Thank you!
1	@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
2	@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
1	@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home
0	@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
0	@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
0	@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
0	@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
1	@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
0	@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
0	"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
1	@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
0	@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
1	@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
0	@united I did... no response back
0	@united this is atrocious customer service.
1	@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares. http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW vía @usatoday
0	@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
0	@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason & now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
0	@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
1	@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?
0	@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
0	@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
0	@united is the worst airline in the world.
0	@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
0	@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
0	@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
0	@united I will but right now I'm to angry
0	@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
0	@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
0	@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
0	@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time & lots of frustrated flyers standing around
0	@united I think DM would be better
0	@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
0	@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions & you couldn't care less!....
0	@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
0	@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0	@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
0	@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0	@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be & says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
1	@united done
1	@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
0	@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
0	@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
0	@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
0	@united Nope. Walked up & down the ORF terminal, & not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
2	@united thank you
0	@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
0	@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
0	@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
2	@united he has no priority and Iove it
2	@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
0	@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
0	@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!
0	@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃
0	@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
0	@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
1	@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
0	@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
0	@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
0	@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
0	@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
0	@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
2	Thank you “@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH”
0	@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alteate flight #NOANSWER
1	@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?
2	@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
0	@United We've been waiting on tarmac for >1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight & we retued to gate. #WTF #fb
0	@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
0	@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
0	@united That's real dedication & conce. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
0	@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
2	@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
2	@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
2	@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom
0	@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0	@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
0	@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
0	@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
0	@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
0	@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
0	@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
1	.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
0	@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
0	@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
2	@united Ok thank again for your help!
0	@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
1	Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
2	@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
2	@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
0	@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us oveight at ORD due to missed cnxns
0	@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
0	"@united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
0	@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
0	@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0	@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
0	@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
0	@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
0	@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
2	@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
0	@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay oveight?
0	@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
0	@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, & you boarded us, sent us back up, & boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
2	"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
0	@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before retuing to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
0	@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
1	@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks.
0	@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
0	@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0	@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
0	@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
0	@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
1	Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
1	But I don't see AA @united
1	@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
0	@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
0	@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
0	@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
2	@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above & beyond to get my stranded family home.
0	@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
0	@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
0	@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
0	@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
2	@united look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
0	@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback & will be better
0	@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
0	@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
0	@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
0	@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
0	@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
0	@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
2	@united ok thx!
1	@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
0	@united go to hell
0	@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
1	@united Definitely will!
0	@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
0	@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
2	@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
2	@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
0	The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
0	@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
2	@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
0	@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0	@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
2	@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
1	@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
2	@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
0	@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
0	@united no chance I wait in ORD all afteoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
0	@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
0	@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
1	@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
0	@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
0	@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
2	@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
2	@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
1	@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
0	@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
0	@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
2	@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
1	@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?
2	@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
0	@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
1	@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3
0	@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
2	@united Just sent! Thanks :)
0	@united already missed  connection ugh
0	@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
0	@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding & I now lost my bag. Help!
0	@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
0	@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
0	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
0	@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
0	@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
0	@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
0	@united that's not even an apology
0	@united that's cool - now what?
0	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
0	@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
1	@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
0	@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
0	@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room
0	@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-eaed dollars is not fine.
1	@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
0	@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?
0	@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
0	@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
0	@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
0	"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
0	@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981
0	@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
0	@united You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
0	"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0	@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member 😔
0	@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
0	"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
0	"@united It's the fact that an inteational should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
0	@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
0	@united a) she's an inteational. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
0	@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
0	@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
2	@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport & are they coming in today on flight911
0	@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
0	@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
0	"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife & 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
0	@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
1	@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
0	@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
0	@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
1	@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation..
0	@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
0	@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
0	"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"

2	@united thank you!
2	@united Thanks for the update.
0	@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0	@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0	@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
0	@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay oveight (again).
1	@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
2	@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
0	@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
0	@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? 😭
0	@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
2	@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
0	@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
0	@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
0	@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 oveight delays. #UnitedAirlines
1	@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
0	@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
2	@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0	@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
0	@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover & are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
0	@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
2	@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
0	@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
0	@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
0	@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
0	@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
0	@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!

1	@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?
0	@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
0	@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
1	@united please see dm!!
0	@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
0	@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
0	@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
0	@united still no response??
1	@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
0	@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
0	"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
0	@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
0	@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
0	@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
2	@united Thanks!
0	@united 768 SFO to BOS and no inteet it is 2015 what gives?
0	@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
0	@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
0	@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
0	@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
0	@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
0	@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
2	@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!
0	@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
0	@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
0	@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead

0	@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
0	@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
2	@united love the new 1st class breakfast!

0	@united how about starting without the robotic response?
1	@united I already did.
0	@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
0	@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
0	@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
0	@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
0	@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500

0	@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
0	@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long & why not make this option available online?
0	@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
0	@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
0	@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
0	.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!

0	@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
0	@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!

0	@united hilarious
0	@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
1	@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
0	"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
0	@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool

1	@united and lea how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
0	@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
0	@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
0	UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.

1	@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
0	@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
0	@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
2	@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
0	"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
1	@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
0	@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback
0	@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
1	@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
0	@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
0	"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
0	@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
0	@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
1	@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
0	@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
0	"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
1	@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
2	@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you😊 http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
0	@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
0	@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days & no change yet
0	@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH
1	@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
0	@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
0	@united literally sucks
2	@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
0	@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
1	@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
0	@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
0	@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
0	@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight & -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket

0	@united Moing! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
0	@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
1	@united the child is two years old
0	@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail

2	@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
0	@united you are terrible.
1	@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
0	@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
0	@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
0	@united … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
0	@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power & lifevests on the floor #UA992 …
0	@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
0	@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
1	@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
0	@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
1	@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
0	@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
0	@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
0	BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL & back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
0	@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
0	@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
0	"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
1	@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
0	@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her retu trip?! No more United
0	@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.
1	@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
0	@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!
0	@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
0	@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
0	@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
0	@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
0	@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
0	@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone & language was very unprofessional.
0	@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
2	@united I wanna be grand staff
0	@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
0	@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
0	@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
0	@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
2	@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
0	@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
0	@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
0	@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&&%$cking plane Ever leaving?
0	@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
0	@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet
0	@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
0	@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
0	"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
0	@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
0	@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
1	@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty
0	@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
0	@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
0	@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
0	@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
0	@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
0	@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
0	@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
0	@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
0	@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
0	@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0	@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
0	@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
2	@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
0	@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
0	@united You are a F&$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
0	@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
2	@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
0	@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
0	@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard ea points back, total BS
0	@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a retu to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
0	@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
0	@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
0	@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
0	@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
0	@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
0	@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
0	@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
0	@united it will be on a different airline.
0	@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
0	"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
0	@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
0	@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 retuing 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
1	@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
0	@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
1	@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
0	@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
0	@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
0	@united i need help but in spanish
0	@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
0	@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this moing (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
1	@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
0	@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
0	@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
1	@united UA1469. Just landed.
0	@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
1	@united flight 435
0	@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
0	@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
0	@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
2	@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
0	@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
0	@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
0	@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
2	@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
0	@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
0	@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
0	@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
0	"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
0	@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0	@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
0	@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
0	@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0	@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
0	@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
0	@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
0	@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
2	@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
0	@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
0	@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
1	@united She is travelling from Melboue (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
1	@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
2	@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
0	@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
0	@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
1	@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
2	“@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z”
0	@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an oveight flight?
0	@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
2	@united thank you!
0	@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
0	@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
0	@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
0	@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this moing from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
0	@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
0	@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
0	@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
0	@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
2	@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
0	@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
0	@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
2	@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)
0	@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
0	@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
0	@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
0	@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
0	@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0	@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
0	"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
0	@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
0	@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
0	@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
0	@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
0	@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
0	@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
0	@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
0	@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
1	@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
0	@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
1	@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
1	@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
0	@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
1	@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
0	@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
0	@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
0	@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac & misses connecting flight always
0	@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
0	@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0	@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
0	@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
2	@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
0	@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
0	@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
0	@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
0	@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
0	@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
0	@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
0	@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
0	@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
0	@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
2	@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!
0	@united lol too little too Late Flight
0	@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
0	@united @FeHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
0	@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
0	@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
0	@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
1	@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
0	@united your seats are god awful.
0	@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
2	@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
0	@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
1	@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
1	@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
0	@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
0	@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
0	@united i sure will
1	@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
0	@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
0	@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
1	@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home 🙌🙌
0	@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0	@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
0	@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
0	@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV>>>FSD on 2.19-2.21.
0	@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1	@united left my iPad on MCO->IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
2	@united social media team is on point on #Oscaight :)
0	@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
0	@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
0	@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1	@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
0	@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
0	@united I need help with a missing bag.
0	@united I was. But I have given up.
1	@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.

0	@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
0	@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
0	@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
0	@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
0	@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
0	@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
0	@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
0	@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
0	@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
0	@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
2	@united thank you for following up!
2	@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
1	@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
0	@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?

1	@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin

0	@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
0	@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
0	@united UA1565 IAH -> SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
0	@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
0	@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
1	@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
1	@united no thanks
0	@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
0	@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
0	@united why do you hate your passengers?
0	@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
0	.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
0	@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
0	@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
0	@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this moing. Not cool!
0	@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
1	@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
1	@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
0	@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
0	@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
0	@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
2	@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
0	@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
0	@united false.
0	@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
2	@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed.
0	.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
1	@united Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM?
0	@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
0	@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
2	@united can Cancelled Flight my flight anytime if this is where they keep me for the night.. http://t.co/avRTOWTyzk
0	@united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn't even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines
0	@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
0	@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
2	@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. 🙅🙅🙅
0	@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
0	@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
0	"@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard"
0	@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
0	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience*
1	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” free tickets , for the i convince .
0	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
0	.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
2	@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground & somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
0	@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
0	@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
0	@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
0	.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
0	@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
0	@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
2	@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
2	@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure
0	@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people.
2	@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all
0	@united customer service what's That???
0	@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Retuing for 'more quick fixes' & breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline

0	@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
0	@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!
1	@united I am UA elite Gold and have a UA Chase pres. plus credit card.  How many EQM's do I need to get Platinum Elite!
0	@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
0	@united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
0	@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
2	@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
0	@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
2	@united look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 Hope you like this beauty 😉 http://t.co/NS1aCFqCdQ
0	@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
0	. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
0	@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
0	@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
1	@united when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven't booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true?
0	@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
0	@united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
0	@united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
0	@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
1	@united I'll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast RT again.
0	@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
0	@united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ??
0	@United​ has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight & the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status.
2	@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
1	@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
2	@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
0	@united yes I have & they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
0	@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
0	@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
2	@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem.
0	@united you guys are complete ass
2	@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
0	@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
2	@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
1	@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
0	@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
0	@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
1	@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
2	@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
0	@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
0	@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
1	@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.
2	@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
1	@united +the plane.
0	"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this moing because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
0	@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston inteational b gate #unitedsucks
0	"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
2	@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos.
0	@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
0	@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
0	@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
0	@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
0	@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
0	@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
0	@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
0	@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
0	@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
0	@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
0	@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
1	@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
0	@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
0	@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
0	@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
0	@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
0	@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
0	@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
0	@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
0	@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
0	@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
0	@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
0	@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
0	@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
0	@united ouch not fair
0	@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
0	@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
0	@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
0	@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
0	"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
2	@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
0	@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
1	@united I'll be calling tomorrow
0	@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
0	@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
0	@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my inteational flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email.
0	@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️
0	@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
1	@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
0	@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
2	@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone.
0	@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
0	@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
0	@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
0	@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
0	@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
0	@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
0	@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
1	@united Okay, just requested to follow.
2	@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 & MPWNC2. Any help appreciated
1	@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team & @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
0	@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour & crew is at their hrs limit & we deplane. Unacceptable.
0	@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
0	@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
0	@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
0	"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
0	@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
0	@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation & no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
0	@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
0	@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
0	@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
0	@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
1	@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in inteational flight?
0	@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
0	@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
0	@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
0	@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
0	@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
0	@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
0	@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
0	@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
0	@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
0	@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
0	@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
0	@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
2	@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
0	@united has terrible customer service & doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
0	@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
2	@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
0	@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
0	@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
0	"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this moing. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
1	@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
0	@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
0	@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
1	@united in fact he received my boarding pass
1	@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
0	“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve & have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 & still not resolved
1	@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
1	@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
0	@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?
1	@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
0	@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!
0	@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
0	@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on inteational itineraries
0	@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
0	@united There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
0	@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
0	@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
0	@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
0	@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (& that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
0	@united Are your eaings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
0	@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎
0	@united you guys are gay
0	@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
0	@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm & it is now 1:40pm & the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
2	@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered
0	@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
1	@united no thank you
0	@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
0	@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
0	@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
0	@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
0	@United rescheduled my retu flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
0	@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
0	@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
0	@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful jouey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
0	@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
0	@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
1	@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for conce?
0	@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
0	@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
0	Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
0	@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
0	@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
0	@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks.
0	@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
0	@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
0	@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
0	@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
1	@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk
0	@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
0	@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
0	@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
0	@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
0	@united  what did you do with my seat. Inteational connection. Seriously?
2	@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
0	@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
0	@united Then you delete my retu ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
0	"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
2	@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
0	@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
0	@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
1	@united tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it.
0	@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
1	@united Did you get your 757 Model?
0	@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
0	@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
0	@united direct messages not going through please help
1	@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures
0	@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
0	@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
0	@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
2	@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
0	@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
0	@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
1	@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
0	@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
0	@united so what's the solution?
0	@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
0	@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
0	@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
2	@united we got it, thanks.
0	@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my retu from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
2	@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Weste Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam
0	@united severely under staffed at Iah.
2	@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff 👏👏👏✈️ def flying #united again.
0	@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
2	@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united 👍
1	@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogotá-Houston?
0	@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
1	@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
0	@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
0	@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
2	@united it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage
1	@united getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks.
0	@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
2	@united thank you
2	@united finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it!
1	@united pls follow for DM
1	@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first.
0	@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
1	@united can you assign seats
0	“@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer
0	@united not my luggage
0	@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
1	@united just added one. Ty
2	@united thanks for the effort. I can get the earliest. Though I will make a complaint for a refund as I am losing one business day tomorrow
1	@united.  Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194.  All runners.  A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx.  Pls. Twitter is watching.
0	@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖
2	@united THANK YOU!
0	@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
0	@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the moing flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
0	@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
0	@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
1	@united pls follow for DM.
0	@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
0	@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
0	@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
0	@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
0	@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
0	@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
0	@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
0	@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
0	@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
2	@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
0	@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
1	@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin
0	@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
0	@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
0	@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
0	@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
1	@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
1	@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
0	@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
1	"@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of ""pilots haven't arrived yet"" announcements."
1	@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
0	@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
1	@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
1	@united same day flights
0	@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
0	@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
0	@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
0	@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
0	@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow moing. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
0	.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
0	"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
0	@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
0	@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
1	@united I6EP18
0	@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
0	@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
1	@united DM'ed you
2	@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back.
1	@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
1	@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
0	@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
0	@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
0	@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO > IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
0	@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
0	@united I have been given a connection with 2 oveight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
2	@united thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD
0	@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
0	@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
0	@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this moing before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
0	@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
0	@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
1	@united with about 25 people trying to get on flights
0	@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc
0	@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
0	@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
2	@united thank you
0	@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
1	@united can you change DKYDE6 to 4583>36 on 2/23 instead of 3636>606>36; original reservation was for 4404>36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled.
0	@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
0	@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
0	@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
0	@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
0	@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
0	@united fuck you for not caring 😢
0	@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up.
1	@united question. Are departure times based off easte central time or the time zone your actually in?
2	Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
0	@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
0	@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
0	@united  of course this moing I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
0	@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
0	@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
0	@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
1	@united Was on NH10 on United ticket, rerouted to IAD due to weather in JFK. Can you get us home on United 5713 or 3277?
0	@united Thank you for wasting my time & money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
0	@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
0	@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
0	@united why would you oveight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
0	@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
0	@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
0	@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
0	@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
0	@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
0	@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
0	@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
2	@united just did! Thank you!
2	@united thank you!
0	"@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying ""think about your next flight..."" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4"
0	@united did your super computer 💩 ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
0	@united - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix!
1	@united we need a new flight to Tucson
0	@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
0	@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
0	@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
0	@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
0	@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
0	@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
2	@united I am - thank you!
0	@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
0	@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
0	@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool.
1	@united sister & BIL stuck in Detroit desperately need to be in Florida flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
0	@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
0	@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website & customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
0	@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
0	@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?
0	@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
1	@united I just sent to you.
0	"@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv"
0	"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
0	@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
0	@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
0	@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
0	@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed & one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting.
0	@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
2	@united thank you for flying me out of the mess at IAD and out to San Diego. http://t.co/tlPBaupIk5
0	@united What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761?
0	@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
0	@united flight #1 no luck on #standby
1	@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks.
1	@united I tried.   We were hung up on, twice. After speaking with someone, then put on hold for 45 minutes.  No resolution.
0	"@united I'm not sure it will have ""next time""..."
0	@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
2	@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO
0	@united you a bish
1	@united Thanks!  Good to know.
1	@united okay. Thanks.
0	@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
1	@united Seat 14A, Flight UA895
1	@united is it on a flight now? Thanks for reply.
0	@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited

1	@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt? Best, Fabrice
0	@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
0	@united since I have an inteational connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!
1	@united need help. Never got tickets. Conf #ggqzqd
1	@united some compensation (e.g. upgrade to higher class for my rescheduled flight to MUC today) will be appreciated, though ;)
0	@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is moing already and I no longer need a hotel room
0	@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
1	"Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til ""U"" are the only ""U"" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks"
0	@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
0	@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house & my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
0	@united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.
0	@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
0	@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
2	@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
0	@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
0	@united no my conces were not addressed
0	@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
0	@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
0	@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
0	@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
0	Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can retu the bag you lost & clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
0	@united you hung up on me again.
0	"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
0	@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
0	@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
0	@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
0	@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
0	.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost & retu it.
0	@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
0	@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
0	@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
0	@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
0	@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0	@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
0	@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
0	@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0	@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
1	@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
0	@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0	@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
0	@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
0	@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
0	@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
0	@united where is our luggage
0	@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
1	@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
0	@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
0	@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
2	@united Life goal: complete ✔️
1	@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? 🌴🌴 It's so cold here.
0	@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
0	"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
0	@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
0	@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
0	@united that's not an apology. Say it.
2	@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
1	@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
0	@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow moing. What do you suggest?
0	@united no apology? Cool.
0	@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
0	@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
0	@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
0	@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airboe to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
0	@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -> IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
0	@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
0	@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
0	@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
0	"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
1	@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
0	@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
0	@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
2	@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
0	@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
0	@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
0	@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
0	@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
0	@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.

0	@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.

0	@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
1	@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
0	@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
1	@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
0	@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
0	@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks

0	@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
1	@united I have a question
0	@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
0	@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
1	@united I see two flights with two seats in the moing can we get on those
0	@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
0	@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
0	@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
0	@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
1	@united we will be at the airport first thing in the moing
0	@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
0	@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
1	@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
0	@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
0	@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water & cookies in business class. #failed
0	@united please get me off this plane #UA57
1	@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow moing. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
1	@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
0	@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
0	@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
0	@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
0	@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
1	@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
0	@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
0	@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
0	@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
2	@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
0	@united has once again eaed a place as the worst airline in the business
1	@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
0	@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
0	@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
0	@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff
0	@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
0	@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
0	@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
1	@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?
0	@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
0	@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
0	"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
0	@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
0	@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
0	@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
0	@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
0	@united Sandra at ur inteational checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
0	@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
0	@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
0	@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
0	@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
0	@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0	@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
0	"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0	@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
1	@united U blow
0	@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0	@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
0	@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he tus 30. #unitedsucksdick
0	.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
1	@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
0	@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
0	@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
0	@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
0	@united you're terrible.
0	@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
0	@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
2	@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0	@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
0	@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
0	@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
0	@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
1	@united why are there no early moing flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
0	@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
2	@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
0	@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
0	@united and waiting
0	@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
2	@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
0	@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
0	@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, & 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag & no resolution
0	@united is the worst
0	@united still waiting
0	@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
0	@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
1	@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?
0	@united & finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
0	@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
1	@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
0	@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
0	@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service & it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
1	@united following
0	@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
1	@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
0	@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
0	@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks

1	@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
0	@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
0	@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
1	@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
0	@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

1	@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
0	@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
0	@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
0	@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
0	@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
0	@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
0	Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
0	@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
0	@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
0	@united never again.
2	@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
1	@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
0	@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow moing. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
0	@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline lea to check the weather and be honest
0	@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
2	@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
1	@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
0	@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
0	@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
0	@united sucks.
0	@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
0	@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
1	@united where's the crew for ua748?
2	@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
0	@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
0	@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was & each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
0	@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
0	@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
0	@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
2	@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
0	@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
0	@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
2	@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.
2	@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!
0	@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline

0	@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
0	@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
1	@united The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/N2fvElcYgz
0	@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
0	@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
1	@united - any way to get a message to an inteational flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
1	@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
0	@united you have a culture issue
0	@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
0	@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
0	@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
1	@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
0	@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
2	@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
0	@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!
0	@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
0	@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
0	@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
0	@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
1	@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling inteationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
0	@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
0	@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
0	@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke

0	@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
1	@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
0	@united haven’t before and haven’t this time & have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing
0	@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
0	@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
0	@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
0	@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
0	@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
0	@united no wheelchairs
0	@united no commitment to a good tuaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
0	@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
0	@united this team added 30 mins on tuaround
2	@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
0	@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
2	@united thanks, we did.
0	@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
2	@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
0	@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
0	@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
0	@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
0	@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
0	@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
0	@united please don't take my membership away :(
0	@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
0	@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
1	@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
0	@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
2	@united I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!
0	@united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”
0	@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
2	So appreciated! @united
2	@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
2	@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!
0	@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
0	@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
0	@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
2	@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
0	@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
0	@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
0	@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
2	@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
0	@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail

0	.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
0	@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
0	@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
0	@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage

0	@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
0	@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
0	@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**

0	"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs & then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
0	@united I am not digging the new mileage eaing plan. I would ea about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
0	@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
0	@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
0	@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
0	@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through useame and email have been down for at least three days.
0	@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
1	@united my dad booked through orbitz and due to weather he can't make it to the airport. Can you help him?

0	@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
2	@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
1	@united any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? :)))) my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!!
0	@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
0	@united airlines 1st & only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
0	@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks.
0	@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
0	@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
0	@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
0	@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
1	@united Hi have a question re future Flight Booking Problems. DUB-JAC 29/9 JAC-LAX 8/10 LAX-DUB 13/10. I'm *G. What is checked bag allowance for JAC-LAX?

2	@united thank you. It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?
0	@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
0	@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
0	@united  Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
0	@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
0	@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
0	@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA & NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
0	"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
0	@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
0	@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
0	@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
0	@united while busy on his cell phone ???
0	@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
0	"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
2	@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
0	@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
0	@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just lea on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check
1	@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
0	@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt ea pqd for me.  How do i get it
0	@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
0	@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
0	@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
0	@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
0	@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
2	@united good job at CLE .. TPA on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! http://t.co/9tbsJquw41

0	"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
0	@united already missed connection... UA 495
0	@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay tus into a Cancelled Flight...
0	"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""

0	@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
0	"@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""..."
0	@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
0	@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
0	@united no still trying to get home.
0	@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
0	@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
0	@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?
2	.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
1	@united @SCVPools Please call me at 310-795-2210.
0	@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
0	@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
0	@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my retu.
0	@united no u don't
0	@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!
1	@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?
0	@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time & gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off.
1	@united you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours.
2	@united DM sent.  Thanks.
0	@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service

0	@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
0	@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
2	@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job 👍.
0	@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
2	@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
0	"@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks."
0	@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea
0	@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring inteationally

0	@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
0	@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
0	@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
0	@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
0	@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
1	@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
1	@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
1	@United #767 taxing in at #ORD @fly2ohare @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/uPocMmuLUN
0	@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
1	@united I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are.
0	@united I miss the Continental days.
0	@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
0	@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
0	@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
0	@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
0	@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough
2	@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunbu away...here comes the cold!
2	@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
0	@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
0	@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate & have little to no information.
1	@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening
0	@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
2	@united Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance.
0	@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.
0	@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
0	@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
0	@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
0	@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
0	@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
2	@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
0	@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
0	@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
0	@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
1	@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
1	I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united
2	@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos.
0	@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
2	@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!
0	"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
0	@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
0	@united you guys suck!
0	@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
0	@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
2	@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise
0	@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
0	@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
1	@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
0	@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
0	@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
1	@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airboe.
0	"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
2	@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time!
0	"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
0	@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
0	@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
0	@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
0	@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
0	@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
1	@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
0	@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
0	@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
2	@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
0	@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
2	@united give her the recognition she deserves!
2	@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year & she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
0	@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
0	@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
2	@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
0	@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
0	@united & on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go
0	@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
0	"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
0	Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
2	@united Thank You
0	"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
0	"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
1	@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
0	. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
0	@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
0	@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
0	@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
0	@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
0	@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
0	@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0	@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
0	@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
1	@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
0	@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
0	"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
0	@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
0	@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
1	@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall
0	@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote & resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels & blasting volume.
0	@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
0	@united Listen, lea & do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA
2	@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
2	@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
0	@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
0	@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
2	@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They tued a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
0	@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
0	@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
0	@united cross country flight SFO>BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
0	@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
1	@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
0	@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
0	@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
0	@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
2	@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!
0	@united Also, group 5 is total BS.
0	@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in retu.
0	@united just like clockwork, Friday afteoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
0	@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
2	@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD-->MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
1	@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?
1	@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
0	@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
0	@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for retu but can't change.
0	@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
2	@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
0	@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
0	@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
2	“@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY” 👏👏
0	@united worst AIRLINE  BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN  BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
0	@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore.
0	@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
1	@united please tell me I'm going to make my connecting flight from O'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere 🙏 http://t.co/qGwK10dEwv
1	@united Lindsay and ??.  Da.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.
0	@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight
0	@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
1	@united OK, thanks for the clarification.
2	@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
0	@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
0	@united delayed another hour
1	@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
0	@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm waing already...
0	@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
0	@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
0	@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back.
0	@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
2	@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
0	@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an inteational flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
0	@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
0	@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
0	@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
0	@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
1	@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
0	@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
0	@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
1	@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
2	@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
1	@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week.
0	@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
0	@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
1	@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
1	@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
0	@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
0	@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
1	@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv
2	@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
0	@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
1	@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS
0	".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
1	@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm waing tomorrow already, what's up?
1	@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
0	@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
0	@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
0	@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
0	@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
0	@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
2	“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
0	@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alteate solution.
1	@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
1	@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
1	@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond
0	@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
0	@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
0	@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
0	@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
0	@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
1	@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
0	@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
0	@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff & landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
0	@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
1	@united DM ed u the request num
0	@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
0	@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
1	@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?
1	@united exactly
0	@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and retued back in o gate that should not count as a valid jouey
0	@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the retu flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
2	@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
1	@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
0	.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
1	@united mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can't DM for some reason.)
2	@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
0	@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
1	@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?
0	@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
2	@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
0	@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
0	@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
2	@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
0	@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
1	@united Followback so I can DM plz
0	@united MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
0	@united your customer service is crap.
0	@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
2	@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your conce.
0	@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
2	@united thanks
0	@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
0	@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
0	@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
0	@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
0	@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
0	@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
2	@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
0	@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
1	@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our tu...
1	@united yes I've boarded this way many times & have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
0	"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is tuing into a Cancelled Flightlation."
0	@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
0	@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
0	@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
2	@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
