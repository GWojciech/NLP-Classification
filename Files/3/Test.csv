0	@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
0	@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
0	@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
0	@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
0	@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0	@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
0	@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
0	@united obviously no one knows a da thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
1	@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?
0	@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
0	@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
0	@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
0	@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
2	@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
0	@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
0	@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
0	@united United Club team is A+ & got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
0	"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
0	@united I was not looking for the fare to be retued on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
2	@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers
1	@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
1	@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
2	@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
0	@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
2	@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
0	@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
0	@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
0	@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
1	“@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP” @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues
0	@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
1	@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
0	@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money & aggravation!
0	@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
0	@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH
2	@united thnx!
0	@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
1	@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
0	@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
0	@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
0	@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
0	@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
0	@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
1	@united Do miles eaed with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
0	@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
1	@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
0	@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll bu it for warmth. #united
2	@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better.
1	@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
0	@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
0	@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
0	@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
2	@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive
0	@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
0	"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""
0	@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
0	@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
0	@united your customer service is terrible
1	@united done
0	@united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
0	"@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback."
0	@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip.
2	@united just sent - thank you!
0	@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
0	@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
0	@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
0	@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
0	@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
2	@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst
0	.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
2	@united thanks, i made it.
1	@united past
2	@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
0	@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
0	@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
1	@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
1	"@united I need a breakdown of what the ""inteational surcharge"" on my flights cover. Please help"
0	@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
0	@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
0	@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
1	@united flight #1051 on 2/23. Thx
1	@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
0	@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
0	@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow

0	@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
0	@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held oveight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
0	@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
1	@united @Adam_Karren @zj76 how did you save the $200 on checked snowboard? Trying to check in this moing, website wants $200! (prem.gold)
1	@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, conceed abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?
0	@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
0	@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
0	@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
2	@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @aizusa flight!
2	@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.
0	@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
1	@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
0	@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
0	@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
1	@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
0	@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
0	.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
0	@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
0	@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
0	@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
0	@united screwing me over twice in one month. Leaed my lesson. We are through.
0	@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
1	@united Will do, cheers
2	@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx
2	@united thnx ^LO :-)
1	@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush.
1	@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
0	"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this moing ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
1	@united Will do! Thanks!
0	@united education of that staff is needed - he also tued away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
0	@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
0	@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
0	@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint & happy customers
0	@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
0	"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
0	@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
2	@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
0	@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
1	@United to start 3xdaily @EmbraerSA #ERJ145 flights from #Chicago @fly2ohare to #Evansville on 4JUN #avgeek
0	"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
0	@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
0	@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
0	@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
1	@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
2	@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
0	@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights & days of work. #UA49
0	@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
2	@united #FirstClass to #London on my way to #LondonFashionWeek #LFW15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
0	@united disappointed to lea you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alteatives.
1	@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
0	@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
0	@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
0	@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
0	@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
1	@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
0	@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
0	@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
0	@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
2	@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.
2	@united awesome new plane flight 1701

2	"@united flt 912. Capt Herman is amazing! Came out before flight to play ""ask the captain anything."" Wonderful ambassador to the airline!!"
0	@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
0	@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
0	@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
0	@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
0	@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
0	@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0	@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
1	@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
0	Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals
2	@united  Thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to FRA. Great service. (cont) http://t.co/46n9kDcsxU
1	@united got it, look forward to hearing from you soon
0	@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
2	Thank you United! “@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN”
0	@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
0	@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
0	@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
1	@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! 😜
1	@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
0	@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
0	@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
0	@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
0	@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
0	"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
0	@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
0	@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
0	@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
0	@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
2	@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
0	@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
0	@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
0	@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
1	@united Any chance you are allowing reFlight Booking Problems yet for travel out of Denver this weekend due to impending storm?
0	we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und
2	@united Thanks Yup I'm all set.  It happens.   SLC ground staff were prompt,  helpful and courteous.
0	"There were plenty of empty seats in coach ""@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f"""
0	"@united all good, didn't die or anything. As they say ""you get what you pay for""!"
2	@united thank you so much. How will you be able to contact me?
2	@united maybe on my retu trip 👍
0	@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
2	@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!
0	@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
2	@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
1	@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
0	@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
0	@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
0	Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
0	@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
1	@united round trip*
0	@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
1	@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
0	@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to Califoia that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
0	@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem & I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
0	.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
2	@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!
2	@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
2	@united thnx
0	@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
2	@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
0	@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
0	@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
0	@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
2	@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
2	@united thanks, that would be awesome.
0	@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
0	@united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
0	@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
2	@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
0	@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to tu it in though...
1	@united I have a LH retu business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?
1	@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?
0	@united €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
1	@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
1	@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
0	@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
0	@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off & left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
1	@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
1	@united - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us).  Help...
0	@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm

0	@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course
1	"@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the ""soft landing"" policy of no more than 1 level?"
1	@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
0	@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled
0	@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
0	@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
0	@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
0	@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my oveight layover tolerable
0	@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Lea from @Delta
0	@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
2	@united thanks, keep up the good work
2	@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was >5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
0	@united any solutions?
1	@united what do you have in mind?
0	@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed & evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
0	@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
0	@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
0	@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
0	@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
0	@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
1	@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
0	@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
1	@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks
0	@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.

0	@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞
2	@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much

2	@united that would be great - 1k us651621
0	@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
0	@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.

0	@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
0	@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
0	@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
0	@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
0	@united broke my suitcase & refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
0	@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
0	@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
1	@united @HiltonWorldwide @Caravannyc @MaysvilleNYC  Let's go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC…as a tourist:  http://t.co/egaEjtRGLb
0	@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
2	@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
1	@united is z and d code airfare refundable?
1	@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt
0	@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
0	@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
1	@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
0	@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
0	@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar & carryons ?
0	@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
0	@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
0	@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
0	"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
0	@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed.
1	@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
1	@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of jouey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
0	@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
0	@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
0	@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
0	@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
0	@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
2	@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
0	@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
0	@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
1	@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
0	@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
0	@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
0	@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
0	@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
0	.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?
1	@united sent DM's
0	@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
0	@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
0	@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
0	@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
0	@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before retuing.
0	@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
0	@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
0	@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
1	@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201

0	@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
1	@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
0	@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
0	@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
1	@United Stars and Bars @iah #A320 @airlineguys @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mWSoGUC33p

0	@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
0	@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
0	@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
0	@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
0	@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
2	@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT COY  as a… http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU

0	@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
2	@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
1	@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
0	@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
0	"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
0	@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…
0	@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
0	@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
0	@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
2	@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
0	@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
0	@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
0	@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
0	@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
0	@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
0	@united Your boarding process sucks. You should lea from @SouthwestAir
0	@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
0	@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A->B than United Airlines!
0	@united What happened this afteoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours. Frustrating!
0	@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
0	@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
2	@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated.
0	@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
0	@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&underserved
2	@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)
0	@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
0	@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
2	@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
2	“@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP” Done!
0	@united service staff to is less than friendly!
1	@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
0	@united Can you transfer my bags too?
0	@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
0	@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
2	@united we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you!

2	@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel 🎉🎉🎉
0	@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
0	@united More conceed that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
2	@united perfect! Thank you!
0	@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
0	@united smiling? NOT!!
0	@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
1	@united will I make it with the delay?
0	@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
0	@united why do you bother surveying me!
1	@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
0	@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
1	@united looking back - never heard from anyone - I had to call and frankly got standard SOP - still think about it today
0	@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it

0	@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
2	@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
0	@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
0	@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
2	@united I will thank you!
2	@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!

0	@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
0	@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
1	@united  Need to change flight from this Tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in FL, Need help!! #custserv

0	"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
0	@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
0	@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
0	@united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
2	@united message sent. Thank you!
0	@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
1	@united THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPE http://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
1	@united @AmericanAir THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPE http://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
0	@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked oveight?

0	@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
1	@united - who can eat at an airport for $7? #areyounew? #incompetent #no800number #feeltheheat
0	@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
0	@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
0	@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
0	@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
0	@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
2	@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
1	@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY conceed.
0	@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?

2	@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
0	@united The flight tued around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
0	@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
0	.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating & am unable to take my flight now.
0	@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
0	@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
1	@united for a fee...
0	@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on

0	@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
2	@united Thank you!! 😊
0	@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
0	@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
1	@united I don't have a milage number. I can't sent my mail to you via DM, you're not following me. I follow you now, so you can sent me a DM
0	@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
0	@united thx. Come hell or high water...
0	@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this moing, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
0	@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
1	@united refund?
1	@united aisle please
2	@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon

2	@united that's fine. I'll take them.
1	@united I live abroad and am Flight Booking Problems flights for when I come visit the states :(
1	@united I have.
0	@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
2	@united thank you! My second flight I already got bumped up to 1st! Love it!
0	@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
0	@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
0	@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
0	@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
2	@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks.
1	@united next day

1	@united @UnitedFlyerHD @United_Airline N26902 Dreamliner leaves London Heathrow. @B787fans http://t.co/aI0Yzwt8Za
0	@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
0	@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
0	@united : Unhappy with United's service? Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO. Leave a comment or RT. http://t.co/O0745APIau
1	@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
0	@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
0	@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
0	@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
1	@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?
2	@united OMG THANK U😻😻😻
0	@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
0	@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
0	@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
0	@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
0	@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
0	@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
1	@united will do. Thank you!
1	@united Okay, thank you both.
1	@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection
0	@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free.
1	@united done as requested.
0	@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
0	@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
2	@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
0	@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
1	@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -> IAD. Is there any way to check if upgrades are available?
1	@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
0	@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
1	@united followed & DM'd.
1	@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
1	@united flight...gotta make this connector
1	@united - ok noted. All details will be DM'ed to you shortly.

0	@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
0	@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
2	@united did I win :)
0	@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
0	@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
1	@united any info on delays at SFO tomorrow due to low clouds?
0	@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
2	@united flight to RSW tonight -me &  twin 3 year olds. A pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys & bags off. Lifesaver!!

1	@united thanks
2	@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20).
0	@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
0	@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
1	@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!
0	@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
0	"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
0	@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
0	@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
1	@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier & I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
0	@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
0	@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
1	@united that's of course in lax
1	@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?
0	@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
0	@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
0	@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
0	@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
0	@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
0	@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
0	@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
0	@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
0	@united & I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
1	@united DCA-EWR Flight #4372
0	@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
0	@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
1	@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
0	@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people & everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
0	@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
0	@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
2	@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
1	@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
0	"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
0	"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
0	@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
1	@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
1	@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!
2	@united Okay, thank you for your help :)
0	@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
2	@united thanks
0	@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't tu a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
2	@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1
1	@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!
0	@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
1	@united was in the air. Just DMd you
0	@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
0	@united yes I have
0	@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
2	@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!
0	@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
0	@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
0	@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
2	@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails
2	@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here.
1	@united sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT! Tnx!
1	@united hey! think someone could meet me with my book when I arrive at @loganairports at 10:30? It's yes please #amypoehler. Oscar took it.
1	@united Hopefully They will give me a feedback, bafore my flight...
2	@united Very good flight, thank you!
0	@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
0	@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
2	@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!
0	@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!

0	@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
0	@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
2	@united Thanks, I will!
0	@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
0	@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
1	@united Flight 280
1	@united Flight 1640 (N33289) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @iah http://t.co/RvCDA2nnme
2	@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
2	@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!
2	@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
1	@united yes, you can. I will DM.
2	@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -> BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)
0	@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
1	@united hi! I just bought a flight with united through ebokeers from Paris to Miami. Do I have any chance to check that everything is ok?
1	@united no worries, I think it’s under control. (the emails are keeping me informed)
0	@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday & that's not guaranteed
1	@united ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I'm kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either.
1	@united what happened to flight status map? It was so cool..
0	@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
1	@united Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help?
0	@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
1	@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?
0	@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
0	@united hello. I'm overseas & my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
2	@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS
0	@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
0	@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice & charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
2	@united thnx
2	@united I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years. You've still got me hooked. (for now!) Peace.
2	@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
0	@united My feedback and conces via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
0	@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
2	@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
0	@united It was quite enjoyable. 😊 Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕
2	@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
2	@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated.
0	@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me & overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
1	“@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?” 👎
0	@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
1	@united Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787.
0	@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
0	@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
1	@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
1	@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
2	@united @parryaftab done thnx
0	@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat & the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
0	@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection.
1	@united PTY to PIT via IAH
0	@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
1	@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
0	@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
1	@united sent
0	@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
2	@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
0	@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
2	@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family
0	@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
2	@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
1	@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers & got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???
2	@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir
0	@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
0	@united correct date is 2/11/15!
0	@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
0	@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
0	@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats.
0	@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
0	@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
0	@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight & insufficient ground crew to handle
0	@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
2	@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
0	@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11
0	"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
0	@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
1	@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
0	@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
0	@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
0	@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
0	@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
0	@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
0	@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
0	@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
1	@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation.
0	@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
0	@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
0	@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
2	@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
0	@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
1	@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
0	“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
0	@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
0	@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
0	@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
2	@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
2	@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane & hold off on trains & automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
0	@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
0	I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
0	@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @buingman ticket instead. & ill be driving there not flying
0	@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
0	@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
2	@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
2	@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)
0	@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
0	@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA & check em in there.
0	@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
0	"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
0	@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
0	@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466
2	@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
0	"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
0	@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
0	@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- & wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!
2	@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
0	@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened
0	@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
0	@united UA6002 MLI->DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN->YEG due to delay.
0	@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
0	@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
1	@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
0	@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
0	@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
0	@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
0	@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait & take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
2	@united thank you!
2	@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0	@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
0	@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
0	@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
0	@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
2	@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
0	@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
0	@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare & rules for this itinerary has changed' again
0	@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 & I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
0	@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
0	@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
0	@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
0	@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist & the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
1	@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
0	@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
0	@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
0	@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
2	@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off
1	@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
2	@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
1	@united flight 5431
0	@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
0	@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
1	@united @ShulemSte @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
0	@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
0	"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
0	@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
0	@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
0	@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
0	@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
0	@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
0	@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
1	@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
0	@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?
0	@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
0	@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
0	@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my eaed miles?
0	@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
1	@united Cancelled Flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name

2	@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you >3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
0	@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
0	@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
0	@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
2	@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
0	@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
0	@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
1	@united trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbeaturals! $$ http://t.co/1L9sCWPhph
0	@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
0	@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
1	@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can’t get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
0	@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
0	"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
0	@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
0	@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
0	@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
1	@united How much is baggage check for Inteational flights?
0	@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
0	"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
0	@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
0	@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
2	@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
1	@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
0	2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
0	1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
0	@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
0	@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
0	@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
0	@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA
0	@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it & it's now impossible! I even called.
2	@united it's amazing really.
0	@united Lea to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
1	@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?
1	@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP
0	@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 & youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn
2	@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
0	@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
0	@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP

0	@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
1	@united ha, this happened 10 years ago. i haven't flown with you since.
0	@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!

0	@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
0	@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
0	"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
0	@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. >--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
2	@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time & apologized for yesterday
0	@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
0	@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis
0	@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines

0	.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
0	.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
0	"@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with eaed ""confirmed"" certificates?"
1	@united You please do not bu my dreams !!!  #buingman tickets sales today.
0	@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts & still didn't make an announcement

1	@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!
0	@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies & expressing that.
0	@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!
0	@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
0	@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
0	.@united: Just landed. A day Late Flight with almost no sleep, but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who's mother died during the night.

1	@united Can I add miles from my January Air China flight to my MileagePlus account?
0	. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
0	@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
2	@united Great, thank you!
1	@united I submitted a status match last week and have not heard back. Im a delta customer looking to switch to United. Please assist.
0	@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
0	@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
1	@united did not get names...Dallas flight and Chicago
0	@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
0	@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
0	@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
0	@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
2	@united Club in Denver is dope 👌
0	@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell.
0	@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
0	@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
0	@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
0	@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
1	@united @annricord January 15th.
0	@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
0	@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
2	@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise
0	@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
0	@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
0	@united Monday evening.
1	"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"

0	@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
2	@united cool, thanks.
0	@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
0	@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
0	@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
0	@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
0	@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
1	@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
1	@united Hi, I am flying domestic first from SEA to HNL. Can I pay to use the lounge before I fly or this is just for inteational? Thanks

1	@united it sucks not having the money to book a flight to see the love of my life. 2600 miles away.
0	@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
0	@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
0	"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
1	@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?
0	@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer
0	@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
1	@united The link in the message I was replying to. #3thparty #ITproblems
1	@united Hi, I read there are weather waings on the East Coast of the US. Would a flight from LHR to SFO be affected?
2	@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
1	@united am I allowed to bring a duffle bag and back pack as my carry on and personal item? Flying out of NY
0	@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
0	@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
0	@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
0	@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
0	@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
0	@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number & how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
0	@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
1	@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.
0	@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
0	@united why are your SFO->BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
0	@united how come I have no baggage updates.
0	@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
0	@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
0	@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my retu for one day Late Flightr?
0	@united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site & can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising
0	@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
0	@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
0	@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
0	@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
0	@united, wtf is your useame and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
1	@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will tu 2 during the trip do I have to buy a retu ticket for my child?
0	@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
2	@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
0	@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
0	@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
0	@united unless it's on you guys, im good.
0	@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
1	@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!
0	@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
0	@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
0	@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
2	@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
0	@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
0	@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
1	@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue

0	"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
0	@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
1	@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
0	@united do you guys have any working planes?
0	@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
0	@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it.
0	@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
0	@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
2	@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)
0	@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)
2	@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
0	@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
0	@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
0	@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
1	@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now.
0	@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
2	@united big up the pilot of 644 for tuing 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
1	@united retued from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
0	@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
0	@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
0	@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
0	@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
1	@united @annricord both!
0	@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
0	@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
0	@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat & we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
0	"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
0	@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
0	@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
0	@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum
0	@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!
2	@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
0	@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
2	@united Got me home amid snow & Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone & an upgrade. Thank you!
0	@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
0	@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
0	@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
0	@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
0	@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
0	@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?
0	@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?
1	@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's inteal email -> http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
0	@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
1	@united 618 was flight out of Houston
0	@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
0	@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
0	@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
1	@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them.
2	"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors “@united: We’re bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
0	@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
1	@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
0	@united how else would I know it was denied?
1	@united obviously
0	@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag. #flyunited
0	@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
0	@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
1	@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.
2	"@united be  ""Chicago's hometown airline"" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise"
0	@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
2	@united Give Cyndi & Troy each a gold star.
2	@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
1	@united how about changing O -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight moing or early afteoon?
1	@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
0	@united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
1	@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
0	@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
0	@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
0	@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
0	@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
0	@united and that plane was staying oveight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
2	@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
0	@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
1	"@united captain ""we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates)"
1	@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
0	@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
1	@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
2	"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
0	@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
0	@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
0	@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
0	@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
0	@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
1	@united I Want a Plane dad
0	@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
0	@united it was an inteational flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
2	@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
0	@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afteoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
0	@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
2	@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
1	"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
0	@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
0	@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
2	@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
2	@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines & alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere
0	@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
0	@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
0	@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
1	@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was bo in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson.
0	@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
2	@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!
2	@united ooh thanks!
0	@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
0	@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
0	@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
1	"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
1	@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now
0	I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
0	@united @annricord 0162431184663. 3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
0	@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
0	@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
0	@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
0	@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
0	@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
2	@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
0	@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
0	@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
0	@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
0	@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
0	@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
0	@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
0	@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in tu got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
0	@united can you not see the thread?
0	@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
0	@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
0	@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO->YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
1	@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare & seats?
2	@united thanks! :)
0	Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
0	@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
0	@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
0	@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
0	@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
0	@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
0	@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call & was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
0	@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
0	@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
0	@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!👎👎
0	@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
0	@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX oveight with our team....AGAIN!
0	@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada & USA on United with only Nexus
0	@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
0	@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is tuing around & heading back to the gate. #connection?
0	@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
0	"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
0	@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
0	@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
0	@united Classic
2	@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
2	@united Thanks!
1	"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
0	@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
0	@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
1	@united no thanks
1	@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now.
0	"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
0	@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0	@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
0	@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
1	@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
0	@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
1	@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300.
0	@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
0	@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
0	@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
0	@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
0	@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
1	@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
0	@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
0	@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
2	@united JT thanks for your help I’ll complete the form once we are back home
0	@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
1	@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
2	@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
1	@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
1	@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)
0	@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
1	@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
0	@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
1	@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com
0	@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
0	@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times. If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
0	@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
0	@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero conce from customer service
0	@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
1	@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
1	@united for our birthdays my fiancé & I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
1	@united I’m resending the confirmation code in a DM
0	@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
1	@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
1	@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?
2	@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the moing when I asked her
0	@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
1	@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
1	@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
2	"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
0	@united worst service ever 😈
0	@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
0	@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
0	@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
2	@united holy high speed inteet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
0	@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
1	@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
0	@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡...
0	@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
2	@united Thanks for the timely service & great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
2	@united done just now, thanks.
1	@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
0	@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
1	@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.
0	@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
0	@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
0	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
1	@united can you send me another confirmation email?
0	@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
0	@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
0	@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
0	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
1	@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant
0	@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
2	@united thank you! 😊
1	@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!
0	@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
0	@united you'd lea if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
0	@united customer service 👎
0	@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
1	@united Hi again, any updates here?
1	@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
0	@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
0	.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
0	@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
0	@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm & now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
0	@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
0	@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
2	@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
0	@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
2	@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
0	@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone retued my call or email. Case number 8273993
0	@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
2	Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
0	@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
0	@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
0	@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
0	@united you are really trying me today.
2	@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
1	@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
0	@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
1	@united was never given one
0	@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
0	@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
0	@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
2	@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.
0	@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
0	@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
0	@united who can tell me where they are?
0	@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
0	@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
0	@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
0	@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
0	@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
0	@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error & now there are no comp seats
0	@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to Califoia? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
0	@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
1	@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam
0	@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
0	@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
0	@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
0	@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
0	@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
0	@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
0	@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
1	@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
0	@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time & told she could board but Karen would not accept
0	@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
0	@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.
0	@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
0	@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
2	@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!
0	@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
0	@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
2	@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time
1	@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
2	@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
0	@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
0	@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
0	@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!

0	@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
0	@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
2	@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
0	@united Second day & attempt trying to leave IAD & I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
1	@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
0	@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
0	@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
2	@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
0	@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh

0	@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
1	"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
0	@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
1	@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

1	Thx! Stand by! “@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH”
1	@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?
0	@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
1	@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
0	@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
1	@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!
2	@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service
0	@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
1	@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
0	@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year & would hate to be in that situation.
0	.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
2	"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
2	@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
2	@united I appreciate the follow up.
0	@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
0	@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
0	@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
0	@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
0	@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
1	@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
0	@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!

0	@united why am i mot getting my refund?
0	.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
0	@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
0	@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
0	@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
0	@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
0	@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
0	@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
0	@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless

0	@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait

2	@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
0	@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?

2	@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
0	@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
2	@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
1	@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
2	@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year retu trip from NYC...#feltthelove

2	@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
0	@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
0	@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
0	@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
1	@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
0	@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
2	@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
0	@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.

2	@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
0	@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
0	@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
0	@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this moing @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness

1	"@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to ""listen to the intercom better""."
2	@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
1	@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
0	@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
0	@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
1	@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.

0	@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
0	@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
2	.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM

2	@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
0	@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
0	@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.

1	@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
0	@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
0	@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
0	@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
1	@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?

0	@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
0	@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
