0	@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
0	@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
0	@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
2	@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)

2	@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
0	@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
1	@united even on inteational flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
0	@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
1	@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.

2	@united thanks
2	@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
1	@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
0	@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
0	@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service

0	@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
0	@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
0	@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&C. #Flyingainteasy
0	@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting inteational flight! It seems so easy, but...
0	@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
0	@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
0	@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
1	@united that's right- with an oveight Miami.
1	@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim & recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
1	@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations
1	@united i DMed you the details
0	@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
1	"@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was ""Inop"". I love a good abbreve."
2	@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
0	@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0	@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
0	@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
1	@united thanks again for your conce. I will contact customer care upon our retu from Australia.
0	@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
2	"@united ""Airport snow removal method #22...""Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU"
0	@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a conce, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
0	@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
0	@united When will email address/useame sign-on be available? It's been a while.
2	@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
0	@united rude rude
0	@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover & I am stuck outside sec
0	@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
0	@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
0	@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
0	@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
0	@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
0	@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
1	@united 6533 ORD to DCA
0	"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
0	@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
0	@united I will not be flying you again
0	@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
1	@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
1	@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
2	@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
0	@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
0	"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
0	@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
0	@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
0	@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
0	@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
0	@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
0	@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
0	@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
0	@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
2	@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat.
1	@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
0	@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
0	@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
0	@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
0	@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
0	@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
0	@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
0	@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
2	@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
1	@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
2	@united thx for update
1	@united thank you !
1	@united dm these nuts
0	@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
0	@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
0	@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
0	@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!

1	@united Thank you.
0	@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my retu ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
1	@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
0	@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.

0	@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
0	@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
0	@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
0	@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
1	@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
0	@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
0	@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
1	@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
1	@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey
0	@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
1	@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
0	@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
0	@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
0	@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking patte of repeated neglect and disrespect.
0	@united Fingers crossed & its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
0	@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
0	@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
0	@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
0	@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
0	.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
1	@united please be good to me this weekend!
0	@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
0	@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
0	@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
1	@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
0	@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an inteational reputation for having problems.
1	@united yall should probably work on that.
0	@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
0	@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0	@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
0	@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
1	@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
0	@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now

0	@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
1	@united DM does not work what do I do?
2	@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again

0	@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
0	@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
0	@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
0	@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
1	.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
2	@united has unrivalled access to #Califoia with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
1	@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
0	@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
0	@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?

2	@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
0	@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
0	@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
0	@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
2	@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
0	@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0	@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
1	@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
0	@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
0	@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
1	@united Okay thank you
1	@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
0	@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service & was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
0	@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
2	@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
0	@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
0	@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
0	@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
0	@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
0	@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
0	@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
2	@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
0	@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
0	@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
1	@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
0	@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
2	@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
2	@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
2	@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
0	@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
1	@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
0	@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation & his original case back!
0	@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
0	@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
0	@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
0	@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
0	@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my retu flight.
1	@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
0	@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
0	@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
2	@united you are one great airline ❤️
0	@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Retuing home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
0	@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
0	@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
1	@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
0	@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
0	@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
1	@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
1	@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
0	@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
2	“@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN” We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
0	@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
0	@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
1	@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
0	@united plus what about food? And taxis?
0	@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
0	@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
0	@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
1	@united yes I do.
0	@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
0	@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
0	@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
0	"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
2	@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
0	@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
1	@united Deep Vein thrombosis
0	@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
0	@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
0	Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
0	@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call & hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
0	@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
1	@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
0	“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
1	@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
0	"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
1	@united DM sent
0	@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
0	@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
2	@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
0	@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
2	@united But thanks for asking
0	@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
0	@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
0	@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades & charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
0	@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
1	@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
2	@united you too!
2	@united is my favorite airline.
0	@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
1	@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
0	@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
0	@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
1	@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
1	@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
0	@united why would they make me share a room?
0	@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
0	@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
0	@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
0	@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
1	@united i understand, thanks
0	@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
0	@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
0	@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
0	@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
2	@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
0	@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and oveight Cancelled Flightations it seems like

0	@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
0	"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
0	@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys lea?
1	@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.
2	@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
0	@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
1	@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
1	@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
0	@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
0	@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
1	@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
1	@united I hope so too
0	@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
0	@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off & left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
0	@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
0	@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
1	@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel pattes enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
0	@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0	@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
0	@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
1	@united where is my flight voucher?
0	@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
0	@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
0	@united yes I filed a claim & hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep & no reimbursement.
0	@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
0	@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
0	@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
0	@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&J sandwich.
0	@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
0	@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
0	@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
2	@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
2	@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
2	@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
0	@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
0	@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
0	@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
0	@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
0	@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
0	@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
0	@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
2	@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
0	@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time & 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
0	@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
2	@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
0	@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
0	@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
0	@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
0	@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
0	@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
0	@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
1	@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
2	@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while..
0	@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
1	@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
0	@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
0	@united comically on the retu flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
0	@united GRK13575M is the file reference
0	@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
0	@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
0	@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
0	@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
1	@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
0	@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
0	@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
2	@united thank you.

1	@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
0	@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
0	“@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what's the point of membership?
0	@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
0	@united Dmed you. Thank you
2	@united thanks we'll be in touch!
2	@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
0	@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
1	@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?
1	@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
1	@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
2	@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
0	@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.

2	@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dos.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
0	@united where's my damn bag??
0	@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
1	@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
1	@united how is Mexico not inteational from the us?
0	@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
0	@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
0	@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
0	@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
0	@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
0	@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
1	Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
0	@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
1	@United so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for oveight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
0	@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
2	@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
0	@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
0	@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
0	@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
0	@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
1	@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ✈️
0	@united So you are inadequate by accident?
2	@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver Inteational Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
2	@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
0	@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
0	@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
0	@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
0	@united ...and when that doesn't work...
1	@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now
0	@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Ea miles but can't use them.
0	@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
0	@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
1	@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
1	@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️
0	@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
1	@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow moing.
0	@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
0	@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
1	@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
0	@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
2	@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
0	@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow moing because all the flights are overbooked.
0	@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
0	@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
0	@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
0	"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
0	@united Exhausted & frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
0	@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
2	@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a retu ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
0	@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0	@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0	@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
0	@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
0	@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
0	@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
2	@united Thank you!
1	@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
2	@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
1	@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home
0	@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
0	@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
0	@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
0	@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
1	@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
0	@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
0	"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
1	@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
0	@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
1	@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
0	@united I did... no response back
0	@united this is atrocious customer service.
1	@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares. http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW vía @usatoday
0	@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
0	@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason & now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
0	@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
1	@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?
0	@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
0	@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
0	@united is the worst airline in the world.
0	@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
0	@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
0	@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
0	@united I will but right now I'm to angry
0	@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
0	@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
0	@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
0	@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time & lots of frustrated flyers standing around
0	@united I think DM would be better
0	@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
0	@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions & you couldn't care less!....
0	@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
0	@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0	@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
0	@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0	@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be & says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
1	@united done
1	@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
0	@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
0	@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
0	@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
0	@united Nope. Walked up & down the ORF terminal, & not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
2	@united thank you
0	@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
0	@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
0	@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
2	@united he has no priority and Iove it
2	@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
0	@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
0	@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!
0	@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃
0	@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
0	@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
1	@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
0	@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
0	@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
0	@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
0	@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
0	@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
2	Thank you “@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH”
0	@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alteate flight #NOANSWER
1	@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?
2	@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
0	@United We've been waiting on tarmac for >1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight & we retued to gate. #WTF #fb
0	@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
0	@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
0	@united That's real dedication & conce. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
0	@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
2	@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
2	@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
2	@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom
0	@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0	@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
0	@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
0	@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
0	@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
0	@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
0	@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
1	.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
0	@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
0	@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
2	@united Ok thank again for your help!
0	@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
1	Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
2	@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
2	@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
0	@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us oveight at ORD due to missed cnxns
0	@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
0	"@united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
0	@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
0	@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0	@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
0	@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
0	@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
0	@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
2	@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
0	@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay oveight?
0	@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
0	@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, & you boarded us, sent us back up, & boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
2	"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
0	@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before retuing to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
0	@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
1	@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks.
0	@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
0	@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0	@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
0	@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
0	@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
1	Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
1	But I don't see AA @united
1	@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
0	@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
0	@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
0	@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
2	@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above & beyond to get my stranded family home.
0	@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
0	@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
0	@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
0	@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
2	@united look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
0	@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback & will be better
0	@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
0	@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
0	@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
0	@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
0	@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
0	@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
2	@united ok thx!
1	@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
0	@united go to hell
0	@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
1	@united Definitely will!
0	@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
0	@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
2	@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
2	@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
0	The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
0	@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
2	@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
0	@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0	@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
2	@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
1	@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
2	@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
0	@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
0	@united no chance I wait in ORD all afteoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
0	@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
0	@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
1	@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
0	@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
0	@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
2	@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
2	@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
1	@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
0	@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
0	@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
2	@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
1	@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?
2	@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
0	@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
1	@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3
0	@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
2	@united Just sent! Thanks :)
0	@united already missed  connection ugh
0	@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
0	@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding & I now lost my bag. Help!
0	@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
0	@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
0	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
0	@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
0	@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
0	@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
0	@united that's not even an apology
0	@united that's cool - now what?
0	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
0	@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
1	@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
0	@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
0	@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room
0	@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-eaed dollars is not fine.
1	@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
0	@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?
0	@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
0	@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
0	@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
0	"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
0	@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981
0	@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
0	@united You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
0	"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0	@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member 😔
0	@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
0	"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
0	"@united It's the fact that an inteational should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
0	@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
0	@united a) she's an inteational. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
0	@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
0	@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
2	@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport & are they coming in today on flight911
0	@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
0	@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
0	"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife & 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
0	@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
1	@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
0	@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
0	@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
1	@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation..
0	@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
0	@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
0	"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"

2	@united thank you!
2	@united Thanks for the update.
0	@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0	@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0	@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
0	@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay oveight (again).
1	@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
2	@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
0	@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
0	@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? 😭
0	@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
2	@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
0	@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
0	@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
0	@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 oveight delays. #UnitedAirlines
1	@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
0	@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
2	@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0	@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
0	@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover & are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
0	@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
2	@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
0	@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
0	@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
0	@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
0	@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
0	@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!

1	@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?
0	@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
0	@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
1	@united please see dm!!
0	@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
0	@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
0	@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
0	@united still no response??
1	@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
0	@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
0	"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
0	@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
0	@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
0	@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
2	@united Thanks!
0	@united 768 SFO to BOS and no inteet it is 2015 what gives?
0	@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
0	@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
0	@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
0	@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
0	@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
0	@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
2	@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!
0	@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
0	@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
0	@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead

0	@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
0	@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
2	@united love the new 1st class breakfast!

0	@united how about starting without the robotic response?
1	@united I already did.
0	@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
0	@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
0	@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
0	@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
0	@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500

0	@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
0	@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long & why not make this option available online?
0	@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
0	@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
0	@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
0	.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!

0	@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
0	@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!

0	@united hilarious
0	@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
1	@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
0	"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
0	@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool

1	@united and lea how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
0	@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
0	@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
0	UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.

1	@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
0	@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
0	@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
2	@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
0	"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
1	@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
0	@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback
0	@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
1	@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
0	@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
0	"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
0	@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
0	@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
1	@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
0	@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
0	"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
1	@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
2	@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you😊 http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
0	@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
0	@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days & no change yet
0	@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH
1	@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
0	@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
0	@united literally sucks
2	@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
0	@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
1	@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
0	@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
0	@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
0	@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight & -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket

0	@united Moing! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
0	@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
1	@united the child is two years old
0	@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail

2	@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
0	@united you are terrible.
1	@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
0	@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
0	@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
0	@united … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
0	@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power & lifevests on the floor #UA992 …
0	@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
0	@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
1	@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
0	@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
1	@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
0	@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
0	@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
0	BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL & back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
0	@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
0	@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
0	"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
1	@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
0	@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her retu trip?! No more United
0	@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.
1	@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
0	@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!
0	@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
0	@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
0	@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
0	@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
0	@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
0	@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone & language was very unprofessional.
0	@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
2	@united I wanna be grand staff
0	@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
0	@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
0	@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
0	@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
2	@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
0	@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
0	@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
0	@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&&%$cking plane Ever leaving?
0	@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
0	@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet
0	@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
0	@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
0	"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
0	@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
0	@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
1	@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty
0	@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
0	@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
0	@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
0	@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
0	@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
0	@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
0	@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
0	@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
0	@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
0	@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0	@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
0	@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
2	@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
0	@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
0	@united You are a F&$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
0	@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
2	@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
0	@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
0	@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard ea points back, total BS
0	@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a retu to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
0	@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
0	@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
0	@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
0	@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
0	@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
0	@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
0	@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
0	@united it will be on a different airline.
0	@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
0	"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
0	@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
0	@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 retuing 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
1	@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
0	@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
1	@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
0	@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
0	@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
0	@united i need help but in spanish
0	@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
0	@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this moing (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
1	@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
0	@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
0	@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
1	@united UA1469. Just landed.
0	@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
1	@united flight 435
0	@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
0	@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
0	@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
2	@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
0	@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
0	@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
0	@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
2	@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
0	@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
0	@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
0	@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
0	"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
0	@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0	@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
0	@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
0	@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0	@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
0	@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
0	@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
0	@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
2	@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
0	@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
0	@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
1	@united She is travelling from Melboue (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
1	@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
2	@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
0	@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
0	@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
1	@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
2	“@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z”
0	@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an oveight flight?
0	@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
2	@united thank you!
0	@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
0	@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
0	@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
0	@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this moing from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
0	@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
0	@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
0	@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
0	@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
2	@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
0	@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
0	@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
2	@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)
0	@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
0	@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
0	@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
0	@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
0	@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0	@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
0	"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
0	@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
0	@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
0	@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
0	@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
0	@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
0	@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
0	@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
0	@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
1	@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
0	@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
1	@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
1	@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
0	@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
1	@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
0	@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
0	@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
0	@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac & misses connecting flight always
0	@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
0	@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0	@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
0	@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
2	@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
0	@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
0	@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
0	@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
0	@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
0	@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
0	@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
0	@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
0	@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
0	@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
2	@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!
0	@united lol too little too Late Flight
0	@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
0	@united @FeHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
0	@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
0	@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
0	@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
1	@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
0	@united your seats are god awful.
0	@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
2	@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
0	@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
1	@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
1	@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
0	@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
0	@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
0	@united i sure will
1	@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
0	@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
0	@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
1	@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home 🙌🙌
0	@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0	@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
0	@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
0	@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV>>>FSD on 2.19-2.21.
0	@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1	@united left my iPad on MCO->IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
2	@united social media team is on point on #Oscaight :)
0	@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
0	@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
0	@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1	@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
0	@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
0	@united I need help with a missing bag.
0	@united I was. But I have given up.
1	@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.

0	@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
0	@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
0	@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
0	@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
0	@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
0	@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
0	@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
0	@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
0	@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
0	@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
2	@united thank you for following up!
2	@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
1	@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
0	@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?

1	@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin

0	@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
0	@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
0	@united UA1565 IAH -> SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
0	@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
0	@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
1	@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
1	@united no thanks
0	@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
0	@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
0	@united why do you hate your passengers?
0	@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
0	.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
0	@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
0	@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
0	@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this moing. Not cool!
0	@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
1	@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
1	@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
0	@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
0	@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
0	@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
2	@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
0	@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
0	@united false.
0	@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
2	@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed.
0	.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
1	@united Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM?
0	@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
0	@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
2	@united can Cancelled Flight my flight anytime if this is where they keep me for the night.. http://t.co/avRTOWTyzk
0	@united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn't even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines
0	@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
0	@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
2	@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. 🙅🙅🙅
0	@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
0	@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
0	"@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard"
0	@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
0	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience*
1	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” free tickets , for the i convince .
0	“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
0	.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
2	@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground & somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
0	@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
0	@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
0	@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
0	.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
0	@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
0	@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
2	@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
2	@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure
0	@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people.
2	@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all
0	@united customer service what's That???
0	@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Retuing for 'more quick fixes' & breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline

0	@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
0	@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!
1	@united I am UA elite Gold and have a UA Chase pres. plus credit card.  How many EQM's do I need to get Platinum Elite!
0	@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
0	@united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
0	@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
2	@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
0	@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
2	@united look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 Hope you like this beauty 😉 http://t.co/NS1aCFqCdQ
0	@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
0	. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
0	@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
0	@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
1	@united when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven't booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true?
0	@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
0	@united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
0	@united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
0	@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
1	@united I'll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast RT again.
0	@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
0	@united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ??
0	@United​ has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight & the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status.
2	@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
1	@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
2	@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
0	@united yes I have & they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
0	@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
0	@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
2	@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem.
0	@united you guys are complete ass
2	@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
0	@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
2	@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
1	@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
0	@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
0	@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
1	@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
2	@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
0	@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
0	@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
1	@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.
2	@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
1	@united +the plane.
0	"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this moing because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
0	@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston inteational b gate #unitedsucks
0	"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
2	@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos.
0	@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
0	@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
0	@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
0	@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
0	@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
0	@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
0	@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
0	@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
0	@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
0	@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
0	@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
1	@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
0	@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
0	@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
0	@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
0	@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
0	@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
0	@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
0	@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
0	@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
0	@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
0	@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
0	@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
0	@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
0	@united ouch not fair
0	@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
0	@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
0	@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
0	@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
0	"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
2	@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
0	@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
1	@united I'll be calling tomorrow
0	@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
0	@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
0	@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my inteational flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email.
0	@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️
0	@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
1	@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
0	@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
2	@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone.
0	@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
0	@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
0	@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
0	@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
0	@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
0	@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
0	@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
1	@united Okay, just requested to follow.
2	@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 & MPWNC2. Any help appreciated
1	@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team & @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
0	@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour & crew is at their hrs limit & we deplane. Unacceptable.
0	@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
0	@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
0	@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
0	"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
0	@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
0	@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation & no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
0	@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
0	@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
0	@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
0	@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
1	@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in inteational flight?
0	@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
0	@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
0	@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
0	@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
0	@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
0	@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
0	@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
0	@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
0	@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
0	@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
0	@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
0	@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
2	@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
0	@united has terrible customer service & doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
0	@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
2	@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
0	@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
0	@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
0	"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this moing. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
1	@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
0	@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
0	@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
1	@united in fact he received my boarding pass
1	@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
0	“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve & have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 & still not resolved
1	@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
1	@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
0	@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?
1	@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
0	@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!
0	@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
0	@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on inteational itineraries
0	@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
0	@united There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
0	@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
0	@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
0	@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
0	@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (& that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
0	@united Are your eaings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
0	@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎
0	@united you guys are gay
0	@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
0	@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm & it is now 1:40pm & the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
2	@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered
0	@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
1	@united no thank you
0	@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
0	@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
0	@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
0	@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
0	@United rescheduled my retu flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
0	@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
0	@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
0	@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful jouey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
0	@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
0	@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
1	@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for conce?
0	@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
0	@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
0	Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
0	@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
0	@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
0	@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks.
0	@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
0	@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
0	@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
0	@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
1	@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk
0	@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
0	@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
0	@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
0	@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
0	@united  what did you do with my seat. Inteational connection. Seriously?
2	@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
0	@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
0	@united Then you delete my retu ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
0	"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
2	@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
0	@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
0	@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
1	@united tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it.
0	@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
1	@united Did you get your 757 Model?
0	@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
0	@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
0	@united direct messages not going through please help
1	@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures
0	@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
0	@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
0	@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
2	@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
0	@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
0	@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
1	@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
0	@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
0	@united so what's the solution?
0	@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
0	@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
0	@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
2	@united we got it, thanks.
0	@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my retu from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
2	@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Weste Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam
0	@united severely under staffed at Iah.
2	@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff 👏👏👏✈️ def flying #united again.
0	@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
2	@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united 👍
1	@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogotá-Houston?
0	@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
1	@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
0	@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
0	@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
2	@united it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage
1	@united getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks.
0	@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
2	@united thank you
2	@united finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it!
1	@united pls follow for DM
1	@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first.
0	@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
1	@united can you assign seats
0	“@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer
0	@united not my luggage
0	@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
1	@united just added one. Ty
2	@united thanks for the effort. I can get the earliest. Though I will make a complaint for a refund as I am losing one business day tomorrow
1	@united.  Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194.  All runners.  A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx.  Pls. Twitter is watching.
0	@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖
2	@united THANK YOU!
0	@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
0	@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the moing flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
0	@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
0	@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
1	@united pls follow for DM.
0	@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
0	@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
0	@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
0	@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
0	@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
0	@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
0	@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
0	@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
0	@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
2	@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
0	@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
1	@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin
0	@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
0	@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
0	@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
0	@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
1	@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
1	@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
0	@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
1	"@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of ""pilots haven't arrived yet"" announcements."
1	@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
0	@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
1	@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
1	@united same day flights
0	@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
0	@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
0	@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
0	@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
0	@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow moing. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
0	.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
0	"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
0	@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
0	@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
1	@united I6EP18
0	@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
0	@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
1	@united DM'ed you
2	@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back.
1	@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
1	@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
0	@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
0	@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
0	@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO > IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
0	@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
0	@united I have been given a connection with 2 oveight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
2	@united thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD
0	@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
0	@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
0	@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this moing before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
0	@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
0	@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
1	@united with about 25 people trying to get on flights
0	@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc
0	@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
0	@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
2	@united thank you
0	@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
1	@united can you change DKYDE6 to 4583>36 on 2/23 instead of 3636>606>36; original reservation was for 4404>36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled.
0	@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
0	@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
0	@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
0	@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
0	@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
0	@united fuck you for not caring 😢
0	@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up.
1	@united question. Are departure times based off easte central time or the time zone your actually in?
2	Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
0	@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
0	@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
0	@united  of course this moing I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
0	@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
0	@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
0	@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
1	@united Was on NH10 on United ticket, rerouted to IAD due to weather in JFK. Can you get us home on United 5713 or 3277?
0	@united Thank you for wasting my time & money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
0	@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
0	@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
0	@united why would you oveight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
0	@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
0	@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
0	@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
0	@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
0	@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
0	@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
0	@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
2	@united just did! Thank you!
2	@united thank you!
0	"@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying ""think about your next flight..."" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4"
0	@united did your super computer 💩 ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
0	@united - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix!
1	@united we need a new flight to Tucson
0	@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
0	@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
0	@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
0	@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
0	@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
0	@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
2	@united I am - thank you!
0	@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
0	@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
0	@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool.
1	@united sister & BIL stuck in Detroit desperately need to be in Florida flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
0	@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
0	@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website & customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
0	@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
0	@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?
0	@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
1	@united I just sent to you.
0	"@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv"
0	"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
0	@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
0	@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
0	@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
0	@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed & one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting.
0	@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
2	@united thank you for flying me out of the mess at IAD and out to San Diego. http://t.co/tlPBaupIk5
0	@united What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761?
0	@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
0	@united flight #1 no luck on #standby
1	@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks.
1	@united I tried.   We were hung up on, twice. After speaking with someone, then put on hold for 45 minutes.  No resolution.
0	"@united I'm not sure it will have ""next time""..."
0	@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
2	@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO
0	@united you a bish
1	@united Thanks!  Good to know.
1	@united okay. Thanks.
0	@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
1	@united Seat 14A, Flight UA895
1	@united is it on a flight now? Thanks for reply.
0	@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited

1	@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt? Best, Fabrice
0	@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
0	@united since I have an inteational connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!
1	@united need help. Never got tickets. Conf #ggqzqd
1	@united some compensation (e.g. upgrade to higher class for my rescheduled flight to MUC today) will be appreciated, though ;)
0	@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is moing already and I no longer need a hotel room
0	@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
1	"Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til ""U"" are the only ""U"" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks"
0	@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
0	@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house & my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
0	@united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.
0	@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
0	@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
2	@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
0	@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
0	@united no my conces were not addressed
0	@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
0	@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
0	@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
0	@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
0	Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can retu the bag you lost & clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
0	@united you hung up on me again.
0	"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
0	@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
0	@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
0	@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
0	@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
0	.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost & retu it.
0	@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
0	@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
0	@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
0	@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
0	@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0	@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
0	@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
0	@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0	@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
1	@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
0	@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0	@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
0	@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
0	@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
0	@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
0	@united where is our luggage
0	@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
1	@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
0	@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
0	@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
2	@united Life goal: complete ✔️
1	@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? 🌴🌴 It's so cold here.
0	@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
0	"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
0	@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
0	@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
0	@united that's not an apology. Say it.
2	@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
1	@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
0	@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow moing. What do you suggest?
0	@united no apology? Cool.
0	@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
0	@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
0	@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
0	@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airboe to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
0	@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -> IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
0	@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
0	@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
0	@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
0	"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
1	@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
0	@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
0	@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
2	@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
0	@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
0	@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
0	@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
0	@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
0	@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.

0	@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.

0	@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
1	@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
0	@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
1	@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
0	@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
0	@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks

0	@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
1	@united I have a question
0	@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
0	@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
1	@united I see two flights with two seats in the moing can we get on those
0	@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
0	@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
0	@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
0	@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
1	@united we will be at the airport first thing in the moing
0	@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
0	@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
1	@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
0	@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
0	@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water & cookies in business class. #failed
0	@united please get me off this plane #UA57
1	@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow moing. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
1	@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
0	@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
0	@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
0	@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
0	@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
1	@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
0	@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
0	@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
0	@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
2	@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
0	@united has once again eaed a place as the worst airline in the business
1	@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
0	@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
0	@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
0	@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff
0	@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
0	@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
0	@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
1	@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?
0	@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
0	@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
0	"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
0	@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
0	@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
0	@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
0	@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
0	@united Sandra at ur inteational checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
0	@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
0	@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
0	@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
0	@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
0	@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0	@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
0	"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0	@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
1	@united U blow
0	@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0	@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
0	@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he tus 30. #unitedsucksdick
0	.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
1	@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
0	@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
0	@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
0	@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
0	@united you're terrible.
0	@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
0	@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
2	@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0	@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
0	@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
0	@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
0	@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
1	@united why are there no early moing flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
0	@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
2	@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
0	@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
0	@united and waiting
0	@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
2	@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
0	@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
0	@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, & 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag & no resolution
0	@united is the worst
0	@united still waiting
0	@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
0	@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
1	@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?
0	@united & finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
0	@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
1	@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
0	@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
0	@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service & it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
1	@united following
0	@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
1	@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
0	@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
0	@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks

1	@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
0	@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
0	@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
1	@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
0	@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

1	@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
0	@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
0	@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
0	@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
0	@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
0	@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
0	Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
0	@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
0	@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
0	@united never again.
2	@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
1	@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
0	@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow moing. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
0	@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline lea to check the weather and be honest
0	@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
2	@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
1	@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
0	@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
0	@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
0	@united sucks.
0	@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
0	@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
1	@united where's the crew for ua748?
2	@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
0	@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
0	@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was & each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
0	@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
0	@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
0	@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
2	@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
0	@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
0	@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
2	@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.
2	@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!
0	@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline

0	@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
0	@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
1	@united The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/N2fvElcYgz
0	@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
0	@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
1	@united - any way to get a message to an inteational flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
1	@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
0	@united you have a culture issue
0	@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
0	@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
0	@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
1	@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
0	@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
2	@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
0	@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!
0	@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
0	@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
0	@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
0	@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
1	@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling inteationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
0	@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
0	@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
0	@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke

0	@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
1	@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
0	@united haven’t before and haven’t this time & have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing
0	@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
0	@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
0	@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
0	@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
0	@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
0	@united no wheelchairs
0	@united no commitment to a good tuaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
0	@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
0	@united this team added 30 mins on tuaround
2	@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
0	@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
2	@united thanks, we did.
0	@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
2	@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
0	@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
0	@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
0	@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
0	@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
0	@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
0	@united please don't take my membership away :(
0	@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
0	@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
1	@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
0	@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
2	@united I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!
0	@united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”
0	@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
2	So appreciated! @united
2	@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
2	@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!
0	@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
0	@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
0	@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
2	@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
0	@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
0	@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
0	@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
2	@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
0	@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail

0	.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
0	@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
0	@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
0	@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage

0	@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
0	@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
0	@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**

0	"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs & then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
0	@united I am not digging the new mileage eaing plan. I would ea about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
0	@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
0	@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
0	@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
0	@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through useame and email have been down for at least three days.
0	@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
1	@united my dad booked through orbitz and due to weather he can't make it to the airport. Can you help him?

0	@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
2	@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
1	@united any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? :)))) my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!!
0	@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
0	@united airlines 1st & only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
0	@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks.
0	@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
0	@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
0	@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
0	@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
1	@united Hi have a question re future Flight Booking Problems. DUB-JAC 29/9 JAC-LAX 8/10 LAX-DUB 13/10. I'm *G. What is checked bag allowance for JAC-LAX?

2	@united thank you. It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?
0	@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
0	@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
0	@united  Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
0	@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
0	@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
0	@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA & NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
0	"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
0	@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
0	@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
0	@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
0	@united while busy on his cell phone ???
0	@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
0	"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
2	@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
0	@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
0	@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just lea on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check
1	@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
0	@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt ea pqd for me.  How do i get it
0	@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
0	@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
0	@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
0	@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
0	@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
2	@united good job at CLE .. TPA on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! http://t.co/9tbsJquw41

0	"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
0	@united already missed connection... UA 495
0	@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay tus into a Cancelled Flight...
0	"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""

0	@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
0	"@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""..."
0	@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
0	@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
0	@united no still trying to get home.
0	@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
0	@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
0	@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?
2	.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
1	@united @SCVPools Please call me at 310-795-2210.
0	@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
0	@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
0	@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my retu.
0	@united no u don't
0	@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!
1	@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?
0	@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time & gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off.
1	@united you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours.
2	@united DM sent.  Thanks.
0	@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service

0	@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
0	@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
2	@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job 👍.
0	@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
2	@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
0	"@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks."
0	@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea
0	@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring inteationally

0	@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
0	@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
0	@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
0	@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
0	@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
1	@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
1	@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
1	@United #767 taxing in at #ORD @fly2ohare @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/uPocMmuLUN
0	@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
1	@united I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are.
0	@united I miss the Continental days.
0	@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
0	@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
0	@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
0	@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
0	@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough
2	@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunbu away...here comes the cold!
2	@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
0	@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
0	@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate & have little to no information.
1	@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening
0	@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
2	@united Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance.
0	@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.
0	@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
0	@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
0	@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
0	@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
0	@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
2	@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
0	@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
0	@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
0	@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
1	@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
1	I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united
2	@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos.
0	@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
2	@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!
0	"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
0	@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
0	@united you guys suck!
0	@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
0	@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
2	@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise
0	@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
0	@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
1	@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
0	@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
0	@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
1	@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airboe.
0	"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
2	@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time!
0	"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
0	@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
0	@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
0	@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
0	@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
0	@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
1	@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
0	@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
0	@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
2	@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
0	@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
2	@united give her the recognition she deserves!
2	@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year & she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
0	@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
0	@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
2	@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
0	@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
0	@united & on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go
0	@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
0	"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
0	Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
2	@united Thank You
0	"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
0	"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
1	@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
0	. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
0	@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
0	@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
0	@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
0	@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
0	@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
0	@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0	@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
0	@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
1	@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
0	@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
0	"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
0	@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
0	@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
1	@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall
0	@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote & resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels & blasting volume.
0	@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
0	@united Listen, lea & do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA
2	@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
2	@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
0	@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
0	@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
2	@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They tued a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
0	@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
0	@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
0	@united cross country flight SFO>BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
0	@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
1	@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
0	@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
0	@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
0	@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
2	@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!
0	@united Also, group 5 is total BS.
0	@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in retu.
0	@united just like clockwork, Friday afteoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
0	@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
2	@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD-->MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
1	@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?
1	@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
0	@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
0	@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for retu but can't change.
0	@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
2	@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
0	@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
0	@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
2	“@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY” 👏👏
0	@united worst AIRLINE  BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN  BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
0	@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore.
0	@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
1	@united please tell me I'm going to make my connecting flight from O'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere 🙏 http://t.co/qGwK10dEwv
1	@united Lindsay and ??.  Da.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.
0	@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight
0	@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
1	@united OK, thanks for the clarification.
2	@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
0	@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
0	@united delayed another hour
1	@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
0	@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm waing already...
0	@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
0	@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
0	@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back.
0	@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
2	@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
0	@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an inteational flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
0	@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
0	@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
0	@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
0	@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
1	@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
0	@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
0	@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
1	@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
2	@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
1	@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week.
0	@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
0	@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
1	@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
1	@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
0	@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
0	@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
1	@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv
2	@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
0	@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
1	@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS
0	".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
1	@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm waing tomorrow already, what's up?
1	@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
0	@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
0	@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
0	@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
0	@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
0	@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
2	“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
0	@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alteate solution.
1	@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
1	@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
1	@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond
0	@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
0	@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
0	@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
0	@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
0	@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
1	@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
0	@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
0	@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff & landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
0	@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
1	@united DM ed u the request num
0	@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
0	@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
1	@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?
1	@united exactly
0	@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and retued back in o gate that should not count as a valid jouey
0	@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the retu flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
2	@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
1	@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
0	.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
1	@united mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can't DM for some reason.)
2	@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
0	@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
1	@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?
0	@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
2	@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
0	@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
0	@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
2	@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
0	@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
1	@united Followback so I can DM plz
0	@united MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
0	@united your customer service is crap.
0	@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
2	@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your conce.
0	@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
2	@united thanks
0	@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
0	@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
0	@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
0	@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
0	@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
0	@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
2	@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
0	@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
1	@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our tu...
1	@united yes I've boarded this way many times & have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
0	"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is tuing into a Cancelled Flightlation."
0	@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
0	@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
0	@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
2	@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
1	@united anything yet JJ?
0	@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
0	@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
0	@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
0	@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
0	@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
0	@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
0	@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
2	@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
0	@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
0	@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
1	@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?

2	@united Thanks!
2	@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
0	@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
2	@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection

2	Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
0	@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
1	@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
0	@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
2	@united thanks for more timely updates.
1	@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
0	@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
0	@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
0	@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
2	@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
1	@united thanks. That means I have 30 minutes to make my inteational connection to HKG
1	@united @JedediahBila KP I am not traveling - we trying to cheer up Ms. Bila.
0	@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
2	@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
1	@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
0	@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
0	@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
2	@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
2	@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
2	@united well played, ^LO.
2	@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
0	@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
0	@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
1	@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
0	@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
1	@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
0	@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
0	@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
1	@united DM sent.
0	@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
0	@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. This day and age message through Twitter travels fast.
0	@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
0	@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
0	@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
0	@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
0	@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
0	@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0	@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
0	@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
0	@united obviously no one knows a da thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
1	@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?
0	@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
0	@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
0	@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
0	@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
2	@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
0	@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
0	@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
0	@united United Club team is A+ & got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
0	"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
0	@united I was not looking for the fare to be retued on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
2	@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers
1	@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
1	@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
2	@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
0	@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
2	@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
0	@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
0	@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
0	@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
1	“@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP” @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues
0	@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
1	@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
0	@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money & aggravation!
0	@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
0	@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH
2	@united thnx!
0	@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
1	@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
0	@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
0	@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
0	@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
0	@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
0	@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
1	@united Do miles eaed with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
0	@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
1	@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
0	@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll bu it for warmth. #united
2	@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better.
1	@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
0	@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
0	@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
0	@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
2	@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive
0	@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
0	"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""
0	@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?

2	@united just sent - thank you!
0	@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
0	@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
0	@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
0	@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
0	@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
2	@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst

0	@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
1	@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
1	"@united I need a breakdown of what the ""inteational surcharge"" on my flights cover. Please help"
0	@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
0	@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed

2	@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.
0	@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
1	@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
0	@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
0	@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
1	@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
0	@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
0	.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
0	@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
0	@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
0	@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
0	@united screwing me over twice in one month. Leaed my lesson. We are through.
0	@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
1	@united Will do, cheers
2	@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx

1	@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush.
1	@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
0	"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this moing ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
1	@united Will do! Thanks!
0	@united education of that staff is needed - he also tued away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
0	@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
0	@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
0	@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint & happy customers
0	@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
0	"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
0	@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
2	@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
0	@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
1	@United to start 3xdaily @EmbraerSA #ERJ145 flights from #Chicago @fly2ohare to #Evansville on 4JUN #avgeek
0	"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
0	@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
0	@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
0	@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
1	@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
2	@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
0	@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights & days of work. #UA49
0	@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
2	@united #FirstClass to #London on my way to #LondonFashionWeek #LFW15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
0	@united disappointed to lea you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alteatives.
1	@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
0	@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
0	@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
0	@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
0	@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
1	@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
0	@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
0	@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
0	@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
2	@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.

2	"@united flt 912. Capt Herman is amazing! Came out before flight to play ""ask the captain anything."" Wonderful ambassador to the airline!!"
0	@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
0	@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
0	@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
0	@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
0	@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
0	@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0	@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
1	@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
0	Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals
2	@united  Thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to FRA. Great service. (cont) http://t.co/46n9kDcsxU
1	@united got it, look forward to hearing from you soon
0	@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
2	Thank you United! “@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN”
0	@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
0	@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
0	@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
1	@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! 😜
1	@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
0	@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
0	@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
0	@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
0	@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
0	"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
0	@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
0	@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
0	@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
0	@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
2	@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
0	@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
0	@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
0	@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
1	@united Any chance you are allowing reFlight Booking Problems yet for travel out of Denver this weekend due to impending storm?
0	we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und
2	@united Thanks Yup I'm all set.  It happens.   SLC ground staff were prompt,  helpful and courteous.

0	"@united all good, didn't die or anything. As they say ""you get what you pay for""!"
2	@united thank you so much. How will you be able to contact me?
2	@united maybe on my retu trip 👍
0	@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
2	@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!
0	@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
2	@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
1	@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
0	@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
0	@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
0	Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
0	@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
1	@united round trip*
0	@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
1	@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
0	@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to Califoia that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
0	@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem & I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
0	.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
2	@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!
2	@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
2	@united thnx
0	@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
2	@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
0	@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
0	@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
0	@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
2	@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
2	@united thanks, that would be awesome.
0	@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
0	@united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
0	@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
2	@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
0	@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to tu it in though...
1	@united I have a LH retu business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?
1	@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?
0	@united €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
1	@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
1	@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
0	@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
0	@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off & left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
1	@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
1	@united - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us).  Help...

1	"@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the ""soft landing"" policy of no more than 1 level?"
1	@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
0	@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled
0	@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
0	@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
0	@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
0	@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my oveight layover tolerable
0	@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Lea from @Delta
0	@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
2	@united thanks, keep up the good work
2	@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was >5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
0	@united any solutions?
1	@united what do you have in mind?
0	@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed & evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
0	@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
0	@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
0	@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
0	@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
0	@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
1	@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
0	@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
1	@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks
0	@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
1	@united What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
0	@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞
2	@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
0	.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
2	@united that would be great - 1k us651621
0	@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
0	@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
0	@united it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
0	@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
0	@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
0	@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
0	@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
0	@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
0	@united broke my suitcase & refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
0	@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
0	@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
1	@united @HiltonWorldwide @Caravannyc @MaysvilleNYC  Let's go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC…as a tourist:  http://t.co/egaEjtRGLb
0	@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
2	@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
1	@united is z and d code airfare refundable?
1	@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt
0	@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
0	@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
1	@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
0	@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
0	@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar & carryons ?
0	@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
0	@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
0	@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
0	"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
0	@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed.
1	@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
1	@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of jouey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
0	@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
0	@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
0	@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
0	@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
0	@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
2	@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
0	@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
0	@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
1	@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
0	@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
0	@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
0	@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
0	@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
0	.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?
1	@united sent DM's
0	@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
0	@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
0	@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
0	@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
0	@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before retuing.
0	@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
0	@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
0	@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
1	@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201

0	@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
1	@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
0	@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
0	@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
1	@United Stars and Bars @iah #A320 @airlineguys @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mWSoGUC33p

0	@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
0	@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
0	@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
0	@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
0	@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
2	@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT COY  as a… http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU

0	@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
2	@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
1	@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
0	@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
0	"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
0	@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…
0	@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
0	@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
0	@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
2	@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
0	@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
0	@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
0	@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
0	@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
0	@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
0	@united Your boarding process sucks. You should lea from @SouthwestAir
0	@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
0	@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A->B than United Airlines!
0	@united What happened this afteoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours. Frustrating!
0	@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
0	@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
2	@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated.
0	@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
0	@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&underserved
2	@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)
0	@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
0	@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
2	@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
2	“@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP” Done!
0	@united service staff to is less than friendly!
1	@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
0	@united Can you transfer my bags too?
0	@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
0	@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
2	@united we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you!

2	@united ok thanks. I sent you a DM too. You can disregard that.
2	@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel 🎉🎉🎉
0	@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
0	@united More conceed that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
2	@united perfect! Thank you!
0	@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
0	@united smiling? NOT!!
0	@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
1	@united will I make it with the delay?
0	@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
0	@united why do you bother surveying me!
1	@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
0	@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
1	@united looking back - never heard from anyone - I had to call and frankly got standard SOP - still think about it today
0	@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it

0	@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
2	@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
0	@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
0	@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
2	@united I will thank you!
2	@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!

0	@united or did you mean 24-26?
0	@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
0	@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
0	@United does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much.
0	@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.

1	@united DM the conf # to you - did you receive it?
0	@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
1	@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145.
0	@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
0	@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
0	@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.

2	@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
0	@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
1	@united @estellevw does she need to complain on Twitter for the refund or is it auto-applied?
0	@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
0	@united Case ID 8544484
1	@united no, I have a pricey Chase Mileage Plus CC.
0	@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
0	@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
2	@United  great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! Looking forward to my global first class suite!

1	@united @perfectomobile Definately not an award for employer of the year #united13
0	@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
0	@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
1	@united  Need to change flight from this Tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in FL, Need help!! #custserv
0	@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
1	@united I have already emailed but I didn't know if it was more expedient to contact you here. Please advise. Thanks.

1	@united is hiring - Flight Dispatcher - Chicago, IL (Network Operations Centerl) https://t.co/lio6oCpTEQ
0	@united That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal.
1	@united have all 747-400s been updated with power outlets and seat-back TVs yet? Flying ORD to Tokyo-Narita on the 28th
0	@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that
2	@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United>

0	@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
0	@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 retu flight..
0	@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
0	@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
0	@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
0	@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
1	@united any news?
0	"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
0	@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
0	@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
0	@united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
2	@united message sent. Thank you!
0	@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
1	@united THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPE http://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
1	@united @AmericanAir THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPE http://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
0	@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked oveight?
0	@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
0	@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
1	@united - who can eat at an airport for $7? #areyounew? #incompetent #no800number #feeltheheat
0	@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
0	@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
0	@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
0	@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
0	@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
2	@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
1	@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY conceed.
0	@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
0	@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
2	@united Thanks JT

2	@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
0	@united The flight tued around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
0	@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
0	.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating & am unable to take my flight now.
0	@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
0	@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
1	@united for a fee...
0	@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
1	"@united Hi, booked a flight yesterday and received an email w/ confirmation number but today I got this error ""no active flight segments"""

0	@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
0	@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
1	@united I don't have a milage number. I can't sent my mail to you via DM, you're not following me. I follow you now, so you can sent me a DM
0	@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
0	@united thx. Come hell or high water...
0	@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this moing, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
0	@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
1	@united refund?
1	@united aisle please
2	@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon

1	@united I live abroad and am Flight Booking Problems flights for when I come visit the states :(
1	@united I have.
0	@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
2	@united thank you! My second flight I already got bumped up to 1st! Love it!
0	@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
0	@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
0	@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
0	@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
2	@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks.
1	@united next day

1	@united @UnitedFlyerHD @United_Airline N26902 Dreamliner leaves London Heathrow. @B787fans http://t.co/aI0Yzwt8Za
0	@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
0	@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
0	@united : Unhappy with United's service? Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO. Leave a comment or RT. http://t.co/O0745APIau
1	@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
0	@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
0	@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
0	@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
1	@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?
2	@united OMG THANK U😻😻😻
0	@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
0	@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
0	@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
0	@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
0	@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
0	@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
1	@united will do. Thank you!
1	@united Okay, thank you both.
1	@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection
0	@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free.
1	@united done as requested.
0	@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
0	@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
2	@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
0	@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
1	@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -> IAD. Is there any way to check if upgrades are available?
1	@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
0	@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
1	@united followed & DM'd.
1	@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
1	@united flight...gotta make this connector
1	@united - ok noted. All details will be DM'ed to you shortly.
0	@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
0	@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, & UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels
0	@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
0	@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
2	@united did I win :)
0	@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
0	@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
1	@united any info on delays at SFO tomorrow due to low clouds?
0	@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
2	@united flight to RSW tonight -me &  twin 3 year olds. A pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys & bags off. Lifesaver!!
0	@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
1	@united thanks
2	@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20).
0	@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
0	@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
1	@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!
0	@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
0	"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
0	@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
0	@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
1	@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier & I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
0	@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
0	@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
1	@united that's of course in lax
1	@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?
0	@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
0	@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
0	@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
0	@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
0	@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
0	@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
0	@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
0	@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
0	@united & I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
1	@united DCA-EWR Flight #4372
0	@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
0	@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
1	@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
0	@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people & everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
0	@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
0	@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
2	@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
1	@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
0	"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
0	"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
0	@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
1	@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
1	@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!
2	@united Okay, thank you for your help :)
0	@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
2	@united thanks
0	@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't tu a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
2	@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1
1	@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!
0	@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
1	@united was in the air. Just DMd you
0	@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
0	@united yes I have
0	@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
2	@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!
0	@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
0	@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
0	@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
2	@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails
2	@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here.
1	@united sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT! Tnx!
1	@united hey! think someone could meet me with my book when I arrive at @loganairports at 10:30? It's yes please #amypoehler. Oscar took it.
1	@united Hopefully They will give me a feedback, bafore my flight...
2	@united Very good flight, thank you!
0	@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
0	@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx

0	@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
0	@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
2	@united Thanks, I will!
0	@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
0	@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
1	@united Flight 280
1	@united Flight 1640 (N33289) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @iah http://t.co/RvCDA2nnme
2	@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
2	@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!
2	@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
1	@united yes, you can. I will DM.
2	@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -> BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)
0	@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
1	@united hi! I just bought a flight with united through ebokeers from Paris to Miami. Do I have any chance to check that everything is ok?
1	@united no worries, I think it’s under control. (the emails are keeping me informed)
0	@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday & that's not guaranteed
1	@united ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I'm kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either.
1	@united what happened to flight status map? It was so cool..
0	@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
1	@united Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help?
0	@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
1	@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?
0	@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
0	@united hello. I'm overseas & my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
2	@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS
0	@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
0	@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice & charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
2	@united thnx
2	@united I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years. You've still got me hooked. (for now!) Peace.
2	@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
0	@united My feedback and conces via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
0	@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
2	@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
0	@united It was quite enjoyable. 😊 Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕
2	@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
2	@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated.
0	@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me & overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
1	“@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?” 👎
0	@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
1	@united Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787.
0	@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
0	@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
1	@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
1	@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
2	@united @parryaftab done thnx
0	@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat & the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
0	@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection.
1	@united PTY to PIT via IAH
0	@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
1	@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
0	@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
1	@united sent
0	@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
2	@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
0	@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
2	@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family
0	@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
2	@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
1	@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers & got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???
2	@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir
0	@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
0	@united correct date is 2/11/15!
0	@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
0	@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
0	@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats.
0	@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
0	@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
0	@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight & insufficient ground crew to handle
0	@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
2	@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
0	@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11
0	"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
0	@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
1	@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
0	@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
0	@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
0	@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
0	@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
0	@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
0	@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
0	@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
1	@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation.
0	@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
0	@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
0	@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
2	@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
0	@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
1	@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
0	“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
0	@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
0	@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
0	@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
2	@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
2	@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane & hold off on trains & automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
0	@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
0	I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
0	@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @buingman ticket instead. & ill be driving there not flying
0	@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
0	@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
2	@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
2	@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)
0	@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
0	@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA & check em in there.
0	@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
0	"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
0	@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
0	@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466
2	@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
0	"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
0	@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
0	@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- & wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!
2	@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
0	@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened
0	@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
0	@united UA6002 MLI->DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN->YEG due to delay.
0	@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
0	@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
1	@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
0	@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
0	@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
0	@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
0	@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait & take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
2	@united thank you!
2	@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0	@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
0	@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
0	@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
0	@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
2	@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
0	@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
0	@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare & rules for this itinerary has changed' again
0	@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 & I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
0	@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
0	@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
0	@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
0	@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist & the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
1	@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
0	@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
0	@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
0	@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
2	@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off
1	@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
2	@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
1	@united flight 5431
0	@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
0	@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
1	@united @ShulemSte @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
0	@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
0	"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
0	@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
0	@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
0	@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
0	@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
0	@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
0	@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
1	@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
0	@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?
0	@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
0	@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
0	@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my eaed miles?
0	@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
1	@united Cancelled Flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name
2	@united Boeing 777 Star Alliance short finals @Heathrowairport 27L on an amazing winters moing #777 #Avgeek http://t.co/owMaXOyEhZ
0	@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
2	@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you >3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
0	@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
0	@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
0	@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
2	@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
0	@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
0	@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
1	@united trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbeaturals! $$ http://t.co/1L9sCWPhph
0	@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
0	@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
1	@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can’t get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
0	@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
0	"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
0	@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
0	@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
0	@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
1	@united How much is baggage check for Inteational flights?
0	@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
0	"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
0	@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
0	@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
2	@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
1	@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
0	2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
0	1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
0	@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
0	@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
0	@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
0	@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA
0	@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it & it's now impossible! I even called.
2	@united it's amazing really.
0	@united Lea to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
1	@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?
1	@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP
0	@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 & youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn
2	@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
0	@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
0	@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP
0	@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.
0	@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
1	@united one last thing....United club crackers...nabisco?? Where are the Pepperidge Farms?
0	@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
1	@united ha, this happened 10 years ago. i haven't flown with you since.
0	@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
0	@united of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else .
2	@united Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew, service on both legs. THANKS
0	@united 65 and 72 year old flying to Tokyo for vacation both with bad knees and this happens https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu @cbcallinaday @CBCNews
0	@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
0	@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
0	"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
0	@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. >--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
2	@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time & apologized for yesterday
0	@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
0	@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis
0	@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
0	@united JH: going to process my refund for wifi. its asking for a receipt #? I never received an email- you guys just whacked my credit card
0	.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
0	.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
0	"@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with eaed ""confirmed"" certificates?"
1	@united You please do not bu my dreams !!!  #buingman tickets sales today.
0	@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts & still didn't make an announcement
0	@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.

1	@united yes, would love an upgrade or voucher,  please give me a call 9148445695
1	@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!
0	@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies & expressing that.
0	@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!
0	@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
0	@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
0	.@united: Just landed. A day Late Flight with almost no sleep, but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who's mother died during the night.

1	@united Can I add miles from my January Air China flight to my MileagePlus account?
0	. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
0	@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
2	@united Great, thank you!
1	@united I submitted a status match last week and have not heard back. Im a delta customer looking to switch to United. Please assist.
0	@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
0	@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
1	@united did not get names...Dallas flight and Chicago
0	@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
0	@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
0	@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
0	@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
2	@united Club in Denver is dope 👌
0	@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell.
0	@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
0	@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
0	@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
0	@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
1	@united @annricord January 15th.
0	@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
0	@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
2	@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise
0	@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
0	@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
0	@united Monday evening.
1	"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"
1	@united leisure. Military personnel for safety reason R highly recommended to not travel in uniform
0	@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
2	@united cool, thanks.
0	@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
0	@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
0	@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
0	@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
0	@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
1	@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
1	@united Hi, I am flying domestic first from SEA to HNL. Can I pay to use the lounge before I fly or this is just for inteational? Thanks
1	"@united Do you mean ""fortunately""? I don't want my flight to be affected! 😉"

0	@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
0	@united >>>>>------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
0	@united >>>>>>-------- do not reply to emails?
0	@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation? Y have i had no correspondence
1	@united it sucks not having the money to book a flight to see the love of my life. 2600 miles away.
0	@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
0	@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
0	"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
1	@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?
0	@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer
0	@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
1	@united The link in the message I was replying to. #3thparty #ITproblems
1	@united Hi, I read there are weather waings on the East Coast of the US. Would a flight from LHR to SFO be affected?
2	@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
1	@united am I allowed to bring a duffle bag and back pack as my carry on and personal item? Flying out of NY
0	@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
0	@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
0	@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
0	@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
0	@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
0	@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number & how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
0	@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
1	@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.
0	@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
0	@united why are your SFO->BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
0	@united how come I have no baggage updates.
0	@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
0	@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
0	@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my retu for one day Late Flightr?
0	@united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site & can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising
0	@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
0	@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
0	@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
0	@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
0	@united, wtf is your useame and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
1	@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will tu 2 during the trip do I have to buy a retu ticket for my child?
0	@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
2	@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
0	@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
0	@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
0	@united unless it's on you guys, im good.
0	@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
1	@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!
0	@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
0	@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
0	@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
2	@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
0	@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
0	@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
1	@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue
2	@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
0	@united RTB>IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
0	"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
0	@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
1	@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
0	@united do you guys have any working planes?
0	@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
0	@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it.
0	@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
0	@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
2	@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)
0	@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)
2	@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
0	@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
0	@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
0	@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
1	@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now.
0	@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
2	@united big up the pilot of 644 for tuing 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
1	@united retued from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
0	@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
0	@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
0	@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
0	@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
1	@united @annricord both!
0	@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
0	@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
0	@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat & we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
0	"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
0	@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
0	@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
0	@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum
0	@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!
2	@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
0	@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
2	@united Got me home amid snow & Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone & an upgrade. Thank you!
0	@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
0	@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
0	@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
0	@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
0	@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
0	@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?
0	@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?
1	@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's inteal email -> http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
0	@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
1	@united 618 was flight out of Houston
0	@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
0	@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
0	@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
1	@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them.
2	"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors “@united: We’re bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
0	@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
1	@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
0	@united how else would I know it was denied?
1	@united obviously
0	@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag. #flyunited
0	@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
0	@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
1	@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.
2	"@united be  ""Chicago's hometown airline"" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise"
0	@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
2	@united Give Cyndi & Troy each a gold star.
2	@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
1	@united how about changing O -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight moing or early afteoon?
1	@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
0	@united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
1	@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
0	@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
0	@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
0	@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
0	@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
0	@united and that plane was staying oveight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
2	@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
0	@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
1	"@united captain ""we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates)"
1	@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
0	@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
1	@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
2	"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
0	@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
0	@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
0	@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
0	@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
0	@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
1	@united I Want a Plane dad
0	@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
0	@united it was an inteational flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
2	@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
0	@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afteoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
0	@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
2	@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
1	"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
0	@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
0	@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
2	@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
2	@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines & alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere
0	@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
0	@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
0	@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
1	@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was bo in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson.
0	@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
2	@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!
2	@united ooh thanks!
0	@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
0	@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
0	@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
1	"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
1	@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now
0	I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
0	@united @annricord 0162431184663. 3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
0	@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
0	@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
0	@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
0	@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
0	@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
2	@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
0	@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
0	@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
0	@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
0	@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
0	@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
0	@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
0	@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in tu got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
0	@united can you not see the thread?
0	@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
0	@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
0	@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO->YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
1	@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare & seats?
2	@united thanks! :)
0	Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
0	@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
0	@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
0	@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
0	@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
0	@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
0	@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call & was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
0	@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
0	@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
0	@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!👎👎
0	@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
0	@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX oveight with our team....AGAIN!
0	@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada & USA on United with only Nexus
0	@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
0	@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is tuing around & heading back to the gate. #connection?
0	@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
0	"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
0	@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
0	@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
0	@united Classic
2	@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
2	@united Thanks!
1	"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
0	@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
0	@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
1	@united no thanks
1	@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now.
0	"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
0	@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0	@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
0	@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
1	@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
0	@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
1	@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300.
0	@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
0	@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
0	@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
0	@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
0	@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
1	@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
0	@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
0	@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
2	@united JT thanks for your help I’ll complete the form once we are back home
0	@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
1	@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
2	@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
1	@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
1	@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)
0	@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
1	@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
0	@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
1	@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com
0	@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
0	@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times. If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
0	@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
0	@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero conce from customer service
0	@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
1	@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
1	@united for our birthdays my fiancé & I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
1	@united I’m resending the confirmation code in a DM
0	@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
1	@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
1	@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?
2	@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the moing when I asked her
0	@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
1	@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
1	@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
2	"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
0	@united worst service ever 😈
0	@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
0	@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
0	@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
2	@united holy high speed inteet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
0	@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
1	@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
0	@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡...
0	@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
2	@united Thanks for the timely service & great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
2	@united done just now, thanks.
1	@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
0	@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
1	@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.
0	@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
0	@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
0	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
1	@united can you send me another confirmation email?
0	@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
0	@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
0	@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
0	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
1	@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant
0	@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
2	@united thank you! 😊
1	@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!
0	@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
0	@united you'd lea if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
0	@united customer service 👎
0	@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
1	@united Hi again, any updates here?
1	@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
0	@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
0	.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
0	@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
0	@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm & now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
0	@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
0	@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
2	@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
0	@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
2	@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
0	@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone retued my call or email. Case number 8273993
0	@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
2	Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
0	@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
0	@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
0	@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
0	@united you are really trying me today.
2	@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
1	@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
0	@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
1	@united was never given one
0	@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
0	@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
0	@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
2	@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.
0	@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
0	@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
0	@united who can tell me where they are?
0	@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
0	@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
0	@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
0	@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
0	@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
0	@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error & now there are no comp seats
0	@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to Califoia? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
0	@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
1	@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam
0	@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
0	@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
0	@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
0	@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
0	@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
0	@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
0	@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
1	@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
0	@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time & told she could board but Karen would not accept
0	@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
0	@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.
0	@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
0	@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
2	@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!
0	@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
0	@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
2	@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time
1	@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
2	@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
0	@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
0	@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
0	@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
1	"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl"
0	@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
0	@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
2	@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
0	@united Second day & attempt trying to leave IAD & I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
1	@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
0	@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
0	@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
2	@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
0	@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
0	@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
0	@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for retu flight home
0	@united spending the afteoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
0	@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
1	@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere magazine with out flying?
0	@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
1	"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
0	@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
1	@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4
1	@United Is Changing Its #MileagePlus Program: Winners and Losers http://t.co/38OTLzAK5d #airline #travel #loyalty #rewards

1	@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
0	@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?
0	@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
1	Thx! Stand by! “@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH”
1	@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?
0	@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
1	@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
0	@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
1	@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!
2	@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service
0	@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
1	@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
0	@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year & would hate to be in that situation.
0	.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
2	"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
2	@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
2	@united I appreciate the follow up.
0	@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
0	@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
0	@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
0	@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
0	@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
1	@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
0	@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
0	@united's first-class #cockup http://t.co/oh7CFv7DHR

1	@united Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
0	@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
0	@united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO
0	@united why am i mot getting my refund?
0	.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
0	@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
0	@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
0	@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
0	@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
0	@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
0	@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
0	@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless
1	@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you :)
0	.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight

0	@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
0	@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
0	@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.

2	@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
0	@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
1	@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 inte positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH

2	@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
0	@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
2	Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp

2	@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
0	@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
2	@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
1	@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
2	@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year retu trip from NYC...#feltthelove

0	@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
2	@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
0	@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
0	@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
0	@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
1	@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
0	@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
2	@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
0	@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.

1	@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas 😉
0	@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
1	@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
0	@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this moing #grateful #businesstrip

0	@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
0	@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this moing @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness

0	@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
1	"@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to ""listen to the intercom better""."
2	@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
1	@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
0	@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
0	@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
1	@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
2	@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
0	@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
1	@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
0	@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
0	@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
0	@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.

1	@SouthwestAir would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons
0	@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&switch.
0	@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????
0	@SouthwestAir tued my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?

1	@SouthwestAir how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol
0	@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated
0	@SouthwestAir Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day #annoyed

0	@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
2	@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
2	@SouthwestAir Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link & read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU
1	@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?

0	@SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou
0	@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?
0	@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail
0	@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
0	@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
2	@SouthwestAir would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;)
2	@SouthwestAir appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers!
1	@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!
1	"@SouthwestAir I notice that there are separate buttons for ""guitar"" and actual ""music"" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this."
1	@SouthwestAir give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything 😆
0	@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
0	@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
1	@SouthwestAir Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer
0	"@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple ""no"" would do; I just want to know. :)"
0	@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
2	@SouthwestAir a nice trip back home after a looong vaca 😊🌴 http://t.co/9TRvfnCedL
0	@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
2	@SouthwestAir It was the usually excellent SWA flight!
0	@SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Tued my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
0	@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
0	@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
0	@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
0	@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or M for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
0	@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
0	@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
1	@SouthwestAir seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.
2	@SouthwestAir Jason (108639) at Gate #3 in SAN made my afteoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!
2	@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
2	@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to Califoia to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline
0	@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
0	@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
1	@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
0	@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
2	@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
0	@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
0	@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
1	@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
2	@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
0	@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
0	@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
0	@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk

2	@SouthwestAir Already signed up!  Thanks!  Looking forward to trying the Southwest experience.
0	@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND
1	@SouthwestAir good to know. Perhaps it was execution then.

2	@SouthwestAir :( Thanks for the opportunity...
0	@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
0	@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
0	@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
2	@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you
2	@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
0	@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
2	@SouthwestAir thank you!
1	@SouthwestAir yes please
2	@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ✈️😃👍
0	@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.

0	@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call

2	@SouthwestAir yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent.
0	@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
0	@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
0	@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
0	@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this moing at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..
0	@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation.
0	@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.

1	@SouthwestAir are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I'm looking at 3/19-3/23
0	@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
0	@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
0	@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
2	@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, & I remain a LOYAL SW customer!

0	@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski & I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
2	@SouthwestAir OH MY GOSH SERIOUSLY?! you just made my day, week, year!!! No one will appreciate this more than me!!!
0	@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭

1	@SouthwestAir In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address.
0	@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.

1	@SouthwestAir Finally got me home #BNASnow
0	@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint & a letter via mail will follow.
0	@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of conce about customer's flying experiences.
0	@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse

0	@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
0	@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
1	@SouthwestAir took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines
0	@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
0	@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
0	@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
0	@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
0	@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.

0	@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
0	@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.

1	“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V” this happened
0	@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
0	@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
0	@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
0	@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
0	@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
0	@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople

0	@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
0	@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
0	@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.

2	@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
0	@JetBlue not an issue but I think training & information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
0	@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!

0	@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
0	@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
0	@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
0	@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
0	@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
0	@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...

0	@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
0	@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
0	@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
0	Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
2	@JetBlue you're still the best
2	@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy
0	@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
1	@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.
0	@JetBlue I am less conceed about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
2	@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it 😃
0	@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and tued the plane around. Incredible!
2	@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
0	"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
0	@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
2	@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
0	".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
0	@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible & certainly not EMV compliant
1	@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
1	@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
0	@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
0	@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
0	@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
0	@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
1	@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
1	@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, & who's with who, & who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)
0	@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
0	@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
0	"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
0	@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
0	@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
0	@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
0	@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
0	@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
0	@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
0	@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
0	@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
0	@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
2	@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
0	@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv & being told by 3 ppl to wait & they'd come back but did not.
1	@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
0	@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa & worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.

0	@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
0	@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is conceed.
0	@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
1	@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
2	“@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.” Me and JetBlue are #BFF 🙏
1	@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
2	@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
0	@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
1	@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
0	@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
0	@JetBlue all day
0	@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
0	@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
1	@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow moing when I have to fight for a seat.
0	@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
0	@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
0	@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
0	@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
2	@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
0	@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.
0	@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
2	@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
1	@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
0	@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
1	@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
0	"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
1	@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ☺️
0	@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
2	@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
1	@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
0	@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
0	@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
0	@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
1	@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?
1	@JetBlue finally! Finally!
0	@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
0	@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
2	@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
1	@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
0	@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
0	@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
0	@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
1	@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
0	@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
0	@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
1	@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
0	@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
1	@JetBlue flight 2008
1	@JetBlue Pittsburgh
0	@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
0	@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
0	@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
0	@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
0	"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
1	@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
0	@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
0	@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
0	@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
0	@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
0	@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
0	@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
0	@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
0	@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
0	@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
2	@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute tuaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
0	@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
0	@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
0	@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
0	@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
0	@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
0	@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
0	@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
1	@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
1	@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!
0	@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
1	@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
0	@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  & as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
0	@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
1	@JetBlue woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX
0	@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
0	@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
1	@JetBlue What confirmation number?
0	@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
0	@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
2	@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock
1	@JetBlue follow for DM please
2	@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
0	@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
0	@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety conce had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
0	@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
2	@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
0	@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
1	@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Ea Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?
0	@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
0	@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
2	@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! 🙌✈️
0	@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
0	@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
0	@JetBlue does not fit in 140
2	@JetBlue love it as always!
0	"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
0	@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
1	As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue
0	@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
1	@JetBlue is there wifi on he plain
2	@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!
0	@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕
0	@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
1	@JetBlue wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX>JFK tomorrow. Can you help?
0	@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
0	@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
1	@JetBlue hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan 🌴
2	@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ☺️✈️
1	@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
0	@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
0	@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
1	@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
0	@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
0	@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
2	@JetBlue you guys rock!
2	@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍
2	@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
0	@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
1	@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
0	@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
0	@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-( I look forward to that do much!
1	@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
1	@JetBlue of course I am!!✈️
0	@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
0	@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
0	@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
2	@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
1	@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
2	@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
2	@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
2	@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
0	@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
2	@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
0	@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
0	@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
0	@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the jouey.
0	@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
0	@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
0	@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
0	@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour inteational flight.
0	@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info & no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot & everyone is cranky
1	@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow moing but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
0	@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
1	@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
0	@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out & expect the unexpected
0	@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
0	@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
2	“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!” Thank you!
0	@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
0	@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
0	.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
0	@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
0	@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
2	@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
0	@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
0	@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed & saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
0	@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
0	@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
1	His name is Enzo 😊 RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg
0	"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
1	@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
0	@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
0	@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.

1	@JetBlue Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H
0	@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too.
0	@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
0	@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
0	@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
0	@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
2	@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
2	@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
0	@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
0	@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
1	@JetBlue don't I always?
2	@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
0	@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newbos on board
0	@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
0	@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
0	@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
0	@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
2	@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
0	"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
0	@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
0	@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
1	@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?
0	@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO

0	@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
1	@JetBlue 795 to Austin
2	@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!
0	@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
0	"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
0	@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
0	@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
0	@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
0	@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
0	@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
0	@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
2	@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
0	@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful

2	@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
0	@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
1	@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
2	@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ

2	@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
0	@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
1	@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
0	@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
0	@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
1	@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
0	@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
0	@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
0	@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
2	@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU
2	@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
0	@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
0	@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
0	@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
0	@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
0	@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
2	@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this moing. Great job
0	@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
2	@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
1	@JetBlue flight16?
0	@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this moing. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
0	"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
1	@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
0	@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
0	@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
0	@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
2	@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!

2	@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
0	@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
0	@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
1	@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
2	@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
2	@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
1	@JetBlue Charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! http://t.co/sEUlpvfn95
2	@JetBlue thx, social media person!
0	@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
1	@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours
1	@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers & crew get there safely!
0	@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!

0	@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
0	@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail

0	@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
0	@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.

2	@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
0	@JetBlue my butt hurts.

0	@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
0	@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
0	@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?

2	@JetBlue here in Austin I saw the water bottles & snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! Im so Flight Booking Problems my next flight with you!

2	@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
1	@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down & is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
1	@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
1	@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
0	@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
0	@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
2	@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
0	@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS.
2	@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I 💙 you!
2	@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
2	@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
0	@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
1	@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day & price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
0	@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
0	@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
0	@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
0	@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO->JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...

1	@JetBlue Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously?
0	@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
0	@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
0	@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
2	@JetBlue thanks
2	@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.

0	@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
0	@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
2	@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
0	@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.

0	@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
0	@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.

1	@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
0	@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail

0	@USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United
0	@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!

2	@USAirways thanks !!!
1	@USAirways so I can make a reservation

0	"@USAirways 167 minutes?  ""Im not trained in that"". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?"
1	@USAirways if I qualify for free 1st checked bag, is that applied at checkin? Same for using companion tickets?

1	@USAirways can I check bags through to my final destination even though I bought separate tickets from IAD to PHL  and PHL to Israel?
0	@USAirways 2day: no coffee & 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
1	@USAirways how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized
1	@USAirways If I’m unable to use my departing flight can I still use the retuing flight?
1	@usairways Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online?
0	@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.

0	@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
0	@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
0	@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
0	@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
2	@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
0	@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
0	@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
2	@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly

0	"@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your ""go to"" maneuver?"
2	@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
0	@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable.
0	@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
0	@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
0	@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
0	@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
0	"@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?"

0	@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!

0	@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE.
0	@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies & realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
1	@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
0	@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
2	@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!

0	@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!

2	@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
0	@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
0	@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
0	@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate.
0	@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
0	@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job & family this is crazy
0	@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
0	@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online

0	@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
0	@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic
0	@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
0	@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
0	@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
0	@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible & not trying to take all my $.
2	@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal & dream of mine!
0	@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
0	@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
2	@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job.
0	@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
0	@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
2	@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
0	@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
0	@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
0	@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
0	@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
0	@USAirways can't get back lost time
0	@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
0	@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
0	@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
2	@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone & everything is fine. Just love the website & app ! Thanks for working on it!
0	@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1
0	@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
0	@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
0	@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note.
0	@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
0	@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
0	@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
0	@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
1	@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
1	@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
0	@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
0	@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open -- My request to merge the accounts is denied
0	@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
0	@USAirways  I open the credit card and ea 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
0	@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
0	@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I
0	@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
0	@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
0	@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo
0	@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold
0	@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
0	@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
0	@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
0	@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help.
0	@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
0	@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday moing.  Can't get info with website issues & inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
0	@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
0	@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
0	@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
2	BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! “@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.”
0	@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
0	@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
0	@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed

0	@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
0	@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account.
0	@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
0	@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service. #socialtantrum
0	@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/
0	@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?

0	@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
0	@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
0	@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
0	@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
0	@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
0	@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
0	@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
0	@USAirways Yes & have already spent 1K+ on the card & paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --> ATL
0	@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
0	@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
1	@USAirways yes, with Delta!
0	@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
0	@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
0	@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
0	@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
1	@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
2	@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it.
1	@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
0	@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
0	@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
0	@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown & I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today
0	@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc & airline #SwitchingBoth
0	@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
0	@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
0	@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow.
0	@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
0	@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
0	@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
0	@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
0	@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
0	@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
0	@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
0	@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
0	@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
0	@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
2	@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
0	@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now & having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
0	@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
1	@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
0	@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to conceed at usairways.
0	@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
0	@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
0	@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
0	@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
0	Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options.
1	@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
0	@USAirways should, but didn’t.
1	@USAirways just now but no general announcement
1	@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
1	@USAirways I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely & relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
0	@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
0	@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
0	@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
0	@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
0	@USAirways very embarrassing.
0	@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0	@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this?
0	@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding & we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
0	@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
0	@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
2	@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
0	@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.
0	@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
0	@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AU07pWD4
0	@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
0	@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight.
0	@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?
1	@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am easte. Thank you.
1	@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?
1	@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
1	@USAirways  can you help me out?
0	@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
1	@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
0	"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
0	@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
2	@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
1	@usairways & @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
0	@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
0	@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
1	@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?
0	@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
0	@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever
0	@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
0	@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
0	@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?
1	@USAirways while I’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came & greeted me & thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat.
0	@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
0	@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 & being argued with.
0	@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
1	@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
0	.@USAirways Have you just given up?
0	.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
0	@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
0	"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
2	Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
0	@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
1	@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
1	@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
1	@USAirways New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7
0	@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
1	@USAirways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please.
0	@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
0	@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
2	@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
0	@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
1	"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, & picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
0	@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
0	@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can retu it to me.
0	@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
0	@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
0	@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
0	@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
0	@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
1	@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
2	@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
0	@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
2	@USAirways ok thanks
0	@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to O and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
0	@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
0	@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
1	@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
0	@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?
2	@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
0	@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
0	@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
2	@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos.
0	@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
0	@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
0	"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
2	@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
0	@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
0	@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
0	@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
1	@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
1	@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
0	@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags

2	@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
1	@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
0	@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
0	@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
0	@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
0	@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
0	@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.

0	@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
0	@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
1	@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
0	@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
0	@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
1	@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
0	@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
0	@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
0	@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors & corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
1	@USAirways following you now
1	@USAirways sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you

2	@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
1	@USAirways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check?

0	@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
0	@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
0	@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
1	@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?
0	@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.
0	@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
0	@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
0	@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
0	@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
0	@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
0	@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
0	@USAirways too Late Flight.
0	@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
2	@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
0	@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
0	@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
1	@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully.
2	@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
0	@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
0	@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
1	"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
0	@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
0	@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
0	@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
0	@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles.
1	@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)
0	@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.
0	"@USAirways US 728 retued to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
0	@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
0	@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment.
0	@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of conce for all aboard.
0	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
0	@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
0	@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
0	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange.
0	@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
1	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
0	"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
0	@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
0	@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
0	@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
0	@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
0	@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
0	@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?

0	@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
0	@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers.
0	@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour & the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
0	@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
0	@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
0	@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
0	@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
0	"@USAirways flights & ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
0	@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
0	@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
0	@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
0	@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
0	@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
2	@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! 👍
0	"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
0	@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
0	@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
0	@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight
1	@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?

2	@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!
0	@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
0	@USAirways I am in meetings in Califoia and have no luggage!!
0	@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
0	@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
0	@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
0	@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways how long for a reply
1	@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
2	@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
0	@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
0	@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times & have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
0	@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
0	@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
0	.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
0	@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
1	@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?
0	@USAirways called 3x & it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for inteational calls is there any way someone can contact me?
0	@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
0	@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077

0	@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
1	@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
0	@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times

1	@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?

0	@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy

1	That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t
0	@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
0	@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
0	@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
0	@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
0	@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline
0	@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside & out. #NotHappy
0	@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
0	@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help
0	@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
0	@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
0	@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
0	@USAirways. wow, awful customer service.
0	@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
0	@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
2	@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏
0	@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alteate? Thank you.
1	@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking.
0	@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
2	@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
0	@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
0	@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
0	@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
0	@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
0	@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒
0	@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
0	@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not tuing a profit anymore?
0	@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
0	@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
0	@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BAUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
0	@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
0	@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
0	@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
0	@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience
0	@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
0	@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
0	@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
0	@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
0	@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
0	@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
0	@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
0	@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!
0	@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area.
0	@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
0	@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
0	@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service
0	@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
1	@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!
2	@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat....
0	@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
0	@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
0	@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any conces for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
0	@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
0	@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
0	@USAirways the call hung up on me..

0	@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
0	@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
0	@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
0	@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday moing flight...no compensation. Ugh
0	@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
0	@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡

0	@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
0	@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
0	@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
0	@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
0	@USAirways My brother & his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather

2	@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)

0	@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alteatives.
2	@USAirways ok. Thank you
0	@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
0	@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
0	@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
0	@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
0	@USAirways is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger
0	@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
0	@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
0	@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
0	@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
0	@USAirways flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt… Is everything ok?
0	@USAirways It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now.
0	@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
0	@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.
2	@USAirways Got it, thanks!
0	@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?
1	@USAirways Inteational
0	@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
0	@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
1	@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
1	@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
0	@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
2	@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
0	@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold & $25.
0	@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Inteet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
0	@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
0	@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
2	@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
0	@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA & that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
0	@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
1	@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights
0	@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
0	@USAirways How the heck does one get the Inteet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
0	@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
0	@USAirways >250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
0	@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
0	@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
0	@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
0	@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
1	@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
0	@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
0	@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
2	@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.
0	@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
0	"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
0	@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
1	@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
0	@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs & then zip
0	@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
0	@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
0	@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
0	@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
0	@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
0	@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold & disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
0	@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
0	@USAirways fuck you.
0	@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
0	@USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst
0	@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
0	@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
0	@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
0	@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
0	@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
2	@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
0	@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help.
0	@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?
0	@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
1	@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?
0	@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
2	@USAirways experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport.  #GreatService. #professionalism
0	@USAirways literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot
0	@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
0	@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke
0	@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
0	@USAirways transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help!
2	@USAirways me too!
0	@USAirways flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction
1	@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?
2	@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
0	@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
0	@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
1	@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your conce. Just wanted to
0	@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
0	@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
0	@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales
0	@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...
0	@USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice
0	@USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM
0	"@USAirways new slogan should be ""if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"""
0	@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents & Jeanine
0	@USAirways I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding.
0	@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir did I mention I'm a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher?
0	@usairways Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp?
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID
0	@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed

0	@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
0	@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
0	@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
0	@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
0	@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother & her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
0	@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
0	@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
0	@USAirways I did & was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
0	@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
0	@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
0	@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
0	@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
0	@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
0	@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
0	@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
0	@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
0	@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered
0	@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-(
1	@USAirways  is a bag that is   23”L x 9”W x 12”H  allowed as a carry on?
0	@USAirways thanks for nothing
1	@USAirways there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO inteet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email?
0	@USAirways 2 bad planes & 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
0	@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
0	@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
2	@USAirways thank you
0	@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
0	"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."
0	@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
0	@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
0	@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
0	@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life
1	@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member.
0	@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout
1	@USAirways How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion?

0	@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed

0	@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
0	@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
2	@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
0	@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
1	@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
1	@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card & I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
0	@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.

0	@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.
0	@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
2	@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
0	@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
1	@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you.
0	@USAirways & also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, & it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
0	@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
0	@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!

2	@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
0	@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
0	@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
2	@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
1	@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta

1	@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?

0	@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since leaed @Delta had one!
1	@USAirways Yes, I get that. I’m asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you?
0	@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
0	@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA
0	@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour & then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
0	@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
0	@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above & beyond for customers? #NotImpressed
0	@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
0	@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
2	@USAirways Thank you
0	@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
2	@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
0	@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
0	@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
1	@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?
1	@USAirways Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback?
0	@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
0	@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
0	@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
0	@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
0	@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
0	@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made
0	@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
0	@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
2	@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
1	@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL
0	@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no retu call back #
1	@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
0	@USAirways the flights weren't from this moing... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which tued into Tuesday
0	@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eteal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
0	@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
0	@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
0	@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
1	@USAirways Done
1	@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
0	@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
0	"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
0	@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
1	@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
0	@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
0	@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP
0	"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
0	@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
2	@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
2	@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service & #support.
0	@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are buing up. This is completely illegal.
0	@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
0	@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
0	@USAirways what is the damn delay????
0	@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
0	@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
0	@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
0	@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
0	.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long & detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
0	@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
0	@Usairways need to lea operations. Sit a plane oveight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
0	@USAirways that the flight was delayed & closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
0	@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
0	@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
2	@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
0	@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
0	@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
0	@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and tu right back around. Unacceptable
0	@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now tued into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
0	@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
0	@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
1	@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️
0	@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
0	@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
2	@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
0	@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
0	@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
0	@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
0	@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
0	@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
0	@USAirways ordered a Scotch & water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
0	@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
0	@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
0	@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
0	@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
0	@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
0	@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
0	"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
1	@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
0	@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
0	@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
0	@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
0	@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
1	@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
0	@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
0	@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
2	@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
0	@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
0	@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
0	.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
0	@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
0	@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
0	@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
0	@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
0	@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
1	@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
2	@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
1	@USAirways I am following you now
0	@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
0	@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0	@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
0	@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
0	@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
0	@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
2	“@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!!
1	@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
0	@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
2	@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
0	@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
0	@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
2	@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
1	@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
0	"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
0	@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
0	@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
0	@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
0	@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
0	@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
0	@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p & we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
0	@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
0	@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
0	@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
0	@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
0	@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
0	@USAirways DCA->HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt & 1 announcement 4 > hour!
0	@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.
0	@USAirways I can't even use my retu flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
0	@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
0	@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
0	@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
0	@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
0	@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!
0	@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
0	@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
0	@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
0	@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
0	@USAirways - BOS -> DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
0	@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
0	@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
0	@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
0	@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??
0	@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
0	@USAirways we can't afford the inteational change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, tus out we can't afford to go home.
1	@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
0	@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our inteational flight, and now we are stranded.
2	@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
0	@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
2	@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
2	@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
0	@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
0	@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
0	@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
0	@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
2	@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
0	@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my conces four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
0	@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
0	@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
0	@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
0	@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.
0	@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
0	@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
0	@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
0	@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
0	@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
2	@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
0	@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
0	@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
0	@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
0	"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
0	"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
1	@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
0	@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious & just goes on & on. I vote for texts if practical :)
0	@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
2	@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
1	@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?
1	@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
0	@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
0	@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
0	@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
0	@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
0	@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
2	@USAirways flight 437 PHX>ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
2	@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —> PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
1	@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
0	@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
2	@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
1	@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
1	@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
0	@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
0	@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
1	@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
1	@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday moing.
2	@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
1	@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
1	@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
2	@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
0	@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
0	@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
0	@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
0	@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
0	@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
0	@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
0	.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances & keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
0	@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡
1	@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
0	@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
2	@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,
2	@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
0	@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
0	@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
0	@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
0	@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
0	@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
0	@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
1	@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
0	@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
0	@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
0	@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
0	@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
0	@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
1	@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
0	@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
0	@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
1	@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
0	@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please

1	@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
2	@USAirways lol me too

0	@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr

0	@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
0	@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts & menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
0	@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
0	@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
0	@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good

0	@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
2	@USAirways thanks.
0	@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
2	@USAirways thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow
1	@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?

2	@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
0	@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
0	@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
0	@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
0	@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
0	@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
0	@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
0	@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel & I've submitted twice online
0	@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
0	@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
0	@USAirways I spent more on the room & transportation then I did the whole flight
0	@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
0	@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
0	@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
0	@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
0	@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
0	@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
0	@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, & give me a useless hotel voucher
0	@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour & a half? I'd like an answer.
0	@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
0	@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
0	@USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
0	@USAirways tus into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
0	Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
0	@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
0	@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
0	@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
2	@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
0	@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
0	@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
0	@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
0	@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
0	@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
0	@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
0	@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
0	@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
0	"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""
2	.@USAirways thanks!
0	@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks
0	@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
2	@USAirways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
0	@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
0	@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
1	@USAirways Is it possible to ea Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?
0	@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
0	@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
0	@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?
2	@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
0	@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
0	@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
0	@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
0	@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
0	@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
0	@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their tu to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
0	@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
0	@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
0	@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
0	@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
0	@USAirways  Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?
0	@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
0	@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us...
0	@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
0	@USAirways your agent did not say
0	@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho
0	@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
0	@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request
0	@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
0	@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
0	@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up

0	@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
0	@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?
0	@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
1	@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game.
