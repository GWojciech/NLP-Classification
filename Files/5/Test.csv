1	@usairways Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online?

0	@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
0	@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
0	@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
0	@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
2	@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
0	@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
0	@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
2	@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly

2	@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
0	@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable.
0	@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
0	@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
0	@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
0	@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
0	"@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?"
0	"@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather….call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?"

0	@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
0	@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.

0	@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE.
0	@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies & realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
1	@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
0	@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
2	@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!

2	@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
0	@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
0	@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
0	@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate.
0	@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
0	@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job & family this is crazy
0	@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
0	@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online

0	@USAirways nope not yet...
0	@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
0	@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic
0	@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
0	@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
0	@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
0	@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible & not trying to take all my $.
2	@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal & dream of mine!
0	@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
0	@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
2	@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job.
0	@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
0	@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
2	@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
0	@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
0	@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
0	@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
0	@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
0	@USAirways can't get back lost time
0	@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
0	@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
0	@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
2	@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone & everything is fine. Just love the website & app ! Thanks for working on it!
0	@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1
0	@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
0	@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
0	@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note.
0	@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
0	@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
0	@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
0	@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
1	@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
1	@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
0	@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
0	@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open -- My request to merge the accounts is denied
0	@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
0	@USAirways  I open the credit card and ea 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
0	@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
0	@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I
0	@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
0	@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
0	@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo
0	@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold
0	@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
0	@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
0	@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
0	@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help.
0	@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
0	@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday moing.  Can't get info with website issues & inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
0	@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
0	@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
0	@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
2	BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! “@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.”
0	@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
0	@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
0	@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed
1	@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency
0	@USAirways terrible service
0	@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove > 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,
0	@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
0	@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account.
0	@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
0	@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service. #socialtantrum
0	@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/
0	@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?

0	@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
0	@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
0	@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
0	@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
0	@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
0	@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
0	@USAirways Yes & have already spent 1K+ on the card & paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --> ATL
0	@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
0	@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
1	@USAirways yes, with Delta!
0	@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
0	@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
0	@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
0	@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
1	@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
2	@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it.
1	@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak

0	@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
0	@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow.
0	@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
0	@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
0	@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
0	@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
0	@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
0	@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
0	@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
0	@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
0	@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
0	@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
2	@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
0	@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now & having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
0	@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
1	@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
0	@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to conceed at usairways.
0	@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
0	@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
0	@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
0	@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
0	Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options.
1	@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
0	@USAirways should, but didn’t.
1	@USAirways just now but no general announcement
1	@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
1	@USAirways I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely & relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
0	@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
0	@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
0	@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
0	@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
0	@USAirways very embarrassing.
0	@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0	@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this?
0	@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding & we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
0	@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
0	@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
2	@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
0	@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.
0	@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
0	@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AU07pWD4
0	@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight

1	@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?
1	@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
1	@USAirways  can you help me out?
0	@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
1	@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
0	"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"

0	@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
1	@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?
0	@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
0	@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever
0	@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
0	@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
0	@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?
1	@USAirways while I’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came & greeted me & thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat.
0	@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
0	@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 & being argued with.
0	@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
1	@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
0	.@USAirways Have you just given up?
0	.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
0	@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
0	"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
2	Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
0	@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
1	@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage

2	@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
0	@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
1	"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, & picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
0	@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
0	@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can retu it to me.
0	@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
0	@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
0	@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
0	@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
0	@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
1	@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
2	@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
0	@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
2	@USAirways ok thanks
0	@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to O and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
0	@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
0	@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
1	@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
0	@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?
2	@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
0	@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
0	@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
2	@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos.
0	@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
0	@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
0	"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
2	@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
0	@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
0	@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
0	@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
1	@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
1	@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
0	@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags

2	@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
1	@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
0	@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
0	@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
0	@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
0	@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
0	@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
0	@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
1	"@USAirways Am I allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag? My suit bag will hang like a jacket would. It is soft sided, 48"""
2	@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
0	@USAirways the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c
0	@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
0	@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
0	@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
1	@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
0	@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
0	@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
1	@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
0	@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
0	@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
0	@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors & corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.

0	@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
0	@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
0	@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
1	@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?
0	@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.
0	@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
0	@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
0	@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
0	@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
0	@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
0	@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
0	@USAirways too Late Flight.
0	@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
2	@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
0	@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
0	@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
1	@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully.
2	@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
0	@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
0	@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline
0	@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
1	"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
0	@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
0	@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
0	@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
0	@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles.
1	@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)
0	@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.
0	"@USAirways US 728 retued to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
0	@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
0	@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment.
0	@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of conce for all aboard.
0	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
0	@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
0	@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
0	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange.
0	@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
1	@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
0	"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
0	@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
0	@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
0	@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
0	@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
0	@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
0	@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?
0	@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT oveight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
0	@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx.
0	@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs & my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
0	@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
0	@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv > CTL . CTL > JAN . JAN > CTL . CTL > GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go.
0	@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
0	@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
0	@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need.
0	@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
0	@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers.
0	@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour & the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
0	@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
0	@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
0	@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
0	@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
0	"@USAirways flights & ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
0	@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
0	@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
0	@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
0	@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
0	@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
2	@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! 👍
0	"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
0	@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
0	@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
0	@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight
1	@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?
0	@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service
0	@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost & no ownership from @USAirways
2	@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
0	@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...
2	@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!
0	@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
0	@USAirways I am in meetings in Califoia and have no luggage!!
0	@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
0	@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
0	@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
0	@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways how long for a reply
1	@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
2	@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
0	@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
0	@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times & have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
0	@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
0	@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
0	.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
0	@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
1	@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?
0	@USAirways called 3x & it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for inteational calls is there any way someone can contact me?
0	@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
0	@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077
0	@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to retu due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever.
0	@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
1	@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE

1	@USAirways Hi, can you attach my AA FF# 94LXA62 to reservation E2KVM4. Thansk!
0	@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
0	@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?
2	@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
0	@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
0	@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
0	@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
1	@USAirways Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks!

0	@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this moing.
0	@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost
0	@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail
2	@USAirways over the phone. I called the 6170 number and she picked up almost immediately.

0	@USAirways We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response!
0	@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
0	@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
1	@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
0	@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times
0	@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
2	@USAirways FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight. So pleasant to with with and rebooked me in lightning speed! Thanks!

0	@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
0	@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
0	@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
0	@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
0	@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline
0	@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside & out. #NotHappy
0	@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
0	@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help
0	@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
0	@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
0	@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
0	@USAirways. wow, awful customer service.
0	@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
0	@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
2	@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏
0	@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alteate? Thank you.
1	@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking.
0	@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
2	@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
0	@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
0	@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
0	@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
0	@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
0	@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒
0	@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
0	@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not tuing a profit anymore?
0	@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
0	@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
0	@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BAUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
0	@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
0	@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
0	@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
0	@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience
0	@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
0	@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
0	@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
0	@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
0	@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
0	@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
0	@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
0	@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!
0	@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area.
0	@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
0	@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
0	@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service
0	@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
1	@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!
2	@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat....
0	@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
0	@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
0	@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any conces for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
0	@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
0	@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight

0	@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
0	@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday moing flight...no compensation. Ugh
0	@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?

0	@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
0	@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
0	@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
0	@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
0	@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
1	@USAirways in a few weeks
0	@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
0	@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
0	@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
0	@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
0	@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
0	@USAirways its fine. Just wondering where my money went...
0	@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
0	@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
0	@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed.
0	@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!

0	@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
0	@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
0	@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
0	@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
0	@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
0	@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
0	@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail.
0	@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again

0	@USAirways depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm.
0	@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
0	@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
0	@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
0	@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
0	@USAirways My brother & his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather

0	@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015

0	@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
0	@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them.

0	@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
0	@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
0	@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
0	@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
0	@USAirways flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt… Is everything ok?
0	@USAirways It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now.
0	@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
0	@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.

0	@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?
1	@USAirways Inteational
0	@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
0	@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
1	@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
1	@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
0	@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
2	@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
0	@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold & $25.
0	@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Inteet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
0	@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
0	@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
2	@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
0	@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA & that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
0	@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
1	@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights
0	@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
0	@USAirways How the heck does one get the Inteet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
0	@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
0	@USAirways >250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
0	@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
0	@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
0	@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
0	@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
1	@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
0	@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
0	@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
2	@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.
0	@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
0	"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
0	@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
1	@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
0	@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs & then zip
0	@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
0	@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
0	@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
0	@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
0	@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
0	@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold & disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
0	@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
0	@USAirways fuck you.
0	@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
0	@USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst
0	@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
0	@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
0	@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
0	@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
0	@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
2	@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
0	@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help.

2	@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
0	@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
0	@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
1	@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your conce. Just wanted to
0	@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.

0	@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
2	@USAirways connection made. Thanks again this week. #daddyshome
0	@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
0	@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
0	@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
0	@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
0	@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother & her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
0	@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
0	@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
0	@USAirways I did & was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
0	@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
0	@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
0	@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
0	@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
0	@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
0	@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
0	@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
0	@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
0	@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered
0	@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-(
1	@USAirways  is a bag that is   23”L x 9”W x 12”H  allowed as a carry on?
0	@USAirways thanks for nothing
1	@USAirways there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO inteet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email?
0	@USAirways 2 bad planes & 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
0	@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
0	@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
2	@USAirways thank you
0	@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
0	"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."
0	@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
0	@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
0	@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
0	@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life
1	@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member.
0	@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout
1	@USAirways How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion?
1	@USAirways Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF http://t.co/WXowZhpgfL

0	@USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen?
0	@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
0	@USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's conce.
0	@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
1	@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
0	@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
0	@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
1	@USAirways I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you

1	@USAirways Yes, it was Sunday.
0	@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
0	@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help & to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
0	@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
0	@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
2	@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
0	@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
1	@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
1	@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card & I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
0	@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
1	@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?

1	@USAirways have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory.  Please evaluate asap.
0	@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
0	@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
0	@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
0	@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail
1	@USAirways will shall see in the next couple of minutes.
0	@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.
0	@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
2	@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
0	@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
1	@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you.
0	@USAirways & also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, & it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
0	@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
0	@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
0	@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?
2	@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
1	@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
0	@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed.
1	@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
0	@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
0	@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
0	@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 & proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
1	@USAirways it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol
1	@USAirways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn
0	"@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's ""not worth it"" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS"
0	"@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail"
0	“@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false
1	@USAirways absolutely
0	@USAirways It wasn't weather this moing.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
0	@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
0	@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has
0	@USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
0	@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
2	@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
0	@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
0	@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
2	@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
1	@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
2	@USAirways Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees. Housing and Education are great opportunities in The GR8 State Of Texas
1	@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.
0	@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
0	@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
0	@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.

0	@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
1	@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
1	@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
2	@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!
0	@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
1	@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afteoon?
1	@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
0	@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
2	@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!
0	@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
0	@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up

2	@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
0	@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect
2	@USAirways Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!
2	@USAirways Good news, we got fixed.

0	@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check & was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
2	@USAirways thank you!
0	@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since leaed @Delta had one!
1	@USAirways Yes, I get that. I’m asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you?
0	@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
0	@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA
0	@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour & then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
0	@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
0	@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above & beyond for customers? #NotImpressed
0	@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
0	@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
2	@USAirways Thank you
0	@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
2	@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
0	@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
0	@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
1	@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
0	@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?
1	@USAirways Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback?
0	@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
0	@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
0	@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
0	@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
0	@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
0	@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made
0	@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
0	@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
2	@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
1	@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL
0	@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no retu call back #
1	@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
0	@USAirways the flights weren't from this moing... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which tued into Tuesday
0	@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eteal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
0	@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
0	@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
0	@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
1	@USAirways Done
1	@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
0	@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
0	"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
0	@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
1	@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
0	@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
0	@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP
0	"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
0	@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
2	@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
2	@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service & #support.
0	@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are buing up. This is completely illegal.
0	@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
0	@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
0	@USAirways what is the damn delay????
0	@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
0	@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
0	@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
0	@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
0	.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long & detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
0	@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
0	@Usairways need to lea operations. Sit a plane oveight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
0	@USAirways that the flight was delayed & closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
0	@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
0	@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
2	@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
0	@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
0	@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
0	@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and tu right back around. Unacceptable
0	@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0	@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now tued into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
0	@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
0	@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
1	@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️
0	@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
0	@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
2	@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
0	@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
0	@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
0	@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
0	@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
0	@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
0	@USAirways ordered a Scotch & water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
0	@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
0	@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
0	@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
0	@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
0	@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
0	@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
0	"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
1	@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
0	@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
0	@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
0	@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
0	@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
1	@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
0	@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
0	@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
2	@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
0	@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
2	@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
0	@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
0	.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
0	@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
0	@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
0	@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
0	@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
0	@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
1	@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
2	@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
1	@USAirways I am following you now
0	@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
0	@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0	@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
0	@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
0	@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
0	@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
2	“@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!!
1	@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
0	@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
2	@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
0	@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
0	@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
2	@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
1	@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
0	"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
0	@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
0	@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
0	@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
0	@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
0	@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
0	@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p & we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
0	@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
0	@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
0	@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
0	@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
0	@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
0	@USAirways DCA->HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt & 1 announcement 4 > hour!
0	@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.
0	@USAirways I can't even use my retu flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
0	@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
0	@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
0	@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
0	@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
0	@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!
0	@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
0	@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
0	@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
0	@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
0	@USAirways - BOS -> DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
0	@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
0	@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
0	@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
0	@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??
0	@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
0	@USAirways we can't afford the inteational change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, tus out we can't afford to go home.
1	@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
0	@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our inteational flight, and now we are stranded.
2	@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
0	@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
2	@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
2	@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
0	@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
0	@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
0	@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
0	@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
2	@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
0	@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my conces four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
0	@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
0	@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
0	@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
0	@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.
0	@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
0	@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
0	@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
0	@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
0	@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
2	@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
0	@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
0	@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
0	@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
0	"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
0	"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
1	@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
0	@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious & just goes on & on. I vote for texts if practical :)
0	@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
2	@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
1	@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?
1	@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
0	@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
0	@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
0	@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
0	@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
0	@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
2	@USAirways flight 437 PHX>ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
2	@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —> PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
1	@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
0	@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
2	@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
1	@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
1	@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
0	@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
0	@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
1	@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
1	@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday moing.
2	@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
1	@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
1	@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
2	@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
0	@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
0	@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
0	@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
0	@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
0	@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
0	@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
0	.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances & keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
0	@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡
1	@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
0	@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
2	@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,
2	@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
0	@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
0	@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
0	@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
0	@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
0	@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
0	@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
1	@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
0	@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
0	@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
0	@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
0	@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
0	@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
1	@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
0	@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
0	@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
1	@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
0	@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please

1	@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
2	@USAirways lol me too
0	@USAirways still waiting on a response
0	@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
0	@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
1	@USAirways How will I change it?
0	@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
1	@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?
2	@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!
2	@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
1	@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
0	@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No waing that our 6 seats changed.
0	@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
0	@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
0	@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad.
0	@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked retu was messed with & with no waing.
1	@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
0	@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
1	@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
0	@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting
0	@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
0	@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Easte @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
0	@USAirways 5 hour cross country moing flight and you have no food? #BadService
1	@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way.
0	@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
0	@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
0	@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored

0	@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
1	@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂
0	@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.

1	@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.

0	@USAirways i hate you
0	@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable
0	@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
0	@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
0	@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy
0	@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
0	"@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land."
0	@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!
1	@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
0	@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.

0	@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA

1	@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
1	@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now
0	@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
0	@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say moing?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
0	@USAirways flying from Manchester inteational to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights..
0	@USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day

1	@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?

0	@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
1	@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to ea miles on it since you're merging?
0	@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!

1	@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
2	@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs & I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
2	@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
0	@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
0	@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM retu. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
0	@USAirways delays to the max
2	@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
0	@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA

0	@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.

0	@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
0	@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
0	@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
2	@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
1	@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
2	@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
0	@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
0	@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned & technically never left LAX.
0	@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
0	@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
2	@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
2	@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
0	@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
0	"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
0	@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
1	@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change
0	@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?
0	@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
0	@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
0	@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
0	@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
0	@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
0	@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
1	@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
0	@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...
0	@USAirways The captain tued off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
0	@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
0	@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
0	@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three & 1/2 hour delay so far & sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
0	@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
0	@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
0	“@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code?
0	@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
0	@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?
0	@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.

0	@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(
0	@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
0	@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
0	@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts & menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
0	@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
0	@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
0	@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good
0	@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
0	"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."
0	@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
0	@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
0	@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
2	@USAirways Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything
0	@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
0	@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
0	@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
0	@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
0	@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready
0	@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic
0	@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate
0	@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
2	@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far
0	@USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.

0	"@USAirways ""admirals club"" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!!"
0	@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats & floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
0	@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
2	@USAirways ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.
0	@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
0	@USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485
1	@USAirways Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona.

2	@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!💺✈️ Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
0	@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck

0	@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
0	@USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
2	@USAirways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work & the push to b better
2	@USAirways thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd
0	@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
0	@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
2	@USAirways thanks.
0	@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
2	@USAirways thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow
1	@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
0	@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
0	@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
0	@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
2	@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
0	@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
0	@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
0	@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
0	@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
0	@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
0	@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
0	@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel & I've submitted twice online
0	@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
0	@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
0	@USAirways I spent more on the room & transportation then I did the whole flight
0	@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
0	@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
0	@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
0	@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
0	@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
0	@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
0	@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, & give me a useless hotel voucher
0	@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour & a half? I'd like an answer.
0	@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
0	@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
0	@USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
0	@USAirways tus into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
0	Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
0	@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
0	@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
0	@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
2	@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
0	@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
0	@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
0	@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
0	@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
0	@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
0	@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
0	@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
0	@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
0	"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""
2	.@USAirways thanks!
0	@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks
0	@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
2	@USAirways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
0	@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
0	@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
1	@USAirways Is it possible to ea Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?
0	@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
0	@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
0	@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?
2	@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
0	@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
0	@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
0	@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
0	@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
0	@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
0	@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their tu to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
0	@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
0	@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
0	@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
0	@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
0	@USAirways  Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?
0	@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
0	@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us...
0	@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
0	@USAirways your agent did not say
0	@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho
0	@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
0	@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request
0	@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
