0	@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
0	@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
0	@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
0	@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
0	@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople

1	@JetBlue I would like the actual email address so I can follow up. thank you.
1	@JetBlue ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels?
0	"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
1	@JetBlue sounds fun! How does that work?
2	@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
0	@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
1	@JetBlue I know there's no actual 'mile high' club, but surely there's something I can join ;-)

2	@jetblue thanks
2	@JetBlue it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt.
0	@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
2	@JetBlue Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
1	@JetBlue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks!
2	@JetBlue thank you!!
0	@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
0	@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check & wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset
0	@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
1	.@JetBlue That's what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it.
2	@JetBlue I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space . Thanks

0	"@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right."
0	@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening.
0	@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí
1	@JetBlue How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I'm liking your inteational options...
0	@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
0	@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
0	@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
2	@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
0	@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet.
0	@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
0	@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better
0	"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"

0	@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
2	@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
0	@JetBlue not an issue but I think training & information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
0	@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!
0	@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
1	Happy for SFO, but hopefully you'll add PDX soon ‚Äú@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!‚Äù

0	@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
1	@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay.
2	@JetBlue mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!!
0	@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
2	@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
0	"@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-"
0	@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
1	@JetBlue sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
0	@JetBlue any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
0	"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report"""
2	@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
0	@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
1	@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
0	@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
0	@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/

2	Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
2	@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!
0	@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
0	@JetBlue üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
0	@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
1	@JetBlue @zakkohane pretty sure he's saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp
0	@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
0	@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
0	@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.

1	@JetBlue such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now.
0	@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
2	"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"

2	@JetBlue thank you!
2	@JetBlue awesome
1	@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your inteal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?
0	@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
0	@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
0	@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
0	@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on üòí
0	@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
0	@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...

0	@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
0	@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
0	@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
0	Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
2	@JetBlue you're still the best
2	@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy
0	@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
1	@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.
0	@JetBlue I am less conceed about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
2	@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it üòÉ
0	@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and tued the plane around. Incredible!
2	@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
0	"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
0	@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
2	@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
0	".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
0	@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible & certainly not EMV compliant
1	@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
1	@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
0	@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
0	@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
0	@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
0	@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
1	@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
1	@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, & who's with who, & who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)
0	@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
0	@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. üòâ Can I tweet at the TSA??
0	"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
0	@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
0	@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
0	@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
0	@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
0	@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
0	@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
0	@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
0	@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
0	@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
2	@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
0	@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv & being told by 3 ppl to wait & they'd come back but did not.
1	@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
0	@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa & worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.

0	@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
0	@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is conceed.
0	@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.

1	@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
0	@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
0	@JetBlue all day
0	@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
0	@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
1	@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow moing when I have to fight for a seat.
0	@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
0	@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
0	@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
0	@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
2	@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
0	@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.

1	@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
0	@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
1	@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.

1	@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
0	@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
0	@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
0	@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue

0	@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
0	@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
1	@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
0	@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
0	@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj

0	@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
0	@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail

0	@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
0	@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
0	@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
0	@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
2	@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute tuaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
0	@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
0	@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
0	@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
0	@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
0	@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
0	@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
0	@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
1	@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
1	@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!
0	@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
1	@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
0	@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  & as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
0	@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
1	@JetBlue woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX
0	@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS
0	@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
1	@JetBlue What confirmation number?
0	@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
0	@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
2	@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock
1	@JetBlue follow for DM please
2	@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
0	@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
0	@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety conce had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
0	@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
2	@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
0	@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
1	@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Ea Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?
0	@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
0	@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
2	@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! üôå‚úàÔ∏è
0	@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
0	@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
0	@JetBlue does not fit in 140
2	@JetBlue love it as always!
0	"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
0	@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
1	As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue
0	@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?

0	@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï
0	@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
1	@JetBlue wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX>JFK tomorrow. Can you help?
0	@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
0	@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs

2	@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è
1	@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
0	@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
0	@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight üòï
1	@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
0	@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
0	@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
2	@JetBlue you guys rock!
2	@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ‚ò∫üëçüëç
2	@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
0	@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
1	@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
0	@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
0	@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-( I look forward to that do much!
1	@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
1	@JetBlue of course I am!!‚úàÔ∏è
0	@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
0	@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
0	@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
2	@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
1	@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
2	@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
2	@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
2	@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
0	@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
2	@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
0	@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
0	@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
0	@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the jouey.
0	@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
0	@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
0	@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
0	@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour inteational flight.
0	@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info & no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot & everyone is cranky
1	@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow moing but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
0	@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
1	@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
0	@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out & expect the unexpected
0	@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
0	@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
2	‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you!
0	@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
0	@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
0	.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
0	@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
0	@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
2	@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
0	@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
0	@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed & saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
0	@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
0	@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.

0	"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
1	@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
0	@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.

0	@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
0	@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
0	@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
0	@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
2	@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
2	@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
0	@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless

0	@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
0	@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
2	@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!

0	@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO

2	@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!
0	@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
0	"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
0	@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
0	@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing

0	@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
0	@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
2	@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!

2	@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
0	@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
1	@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
2	@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ

2	@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
0	@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
1	@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
0	@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
0	@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
1	@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
0	@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
0	@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
0	@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.

2	@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
0	@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
0	@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
0	@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
0	@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
0	@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
2	@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this moing. Great job

2	@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
1	@JetBlue flight16?
0	@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this moing. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
0	"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
1	@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
0	@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?

0	@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
0	@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
1	@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!

0	@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
2	@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
0	@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
1	@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive & that will be our flight to depart.
2	@JetBlue done, thank you!

0	@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
0	@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.

2	@JetBlue great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline.

0	@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
0	@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail

2	@JetBlue I LOVE JET BLUE!
0	@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
1	@JetBlue So anything found while cleaning the plane in DC would be at the baggage office, even something small?

1	@JetBlue Hi. I'm trying to find a flight to the Middle East.
0	@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
0	@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
0	@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
2	@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
0	@JetBlue my butt hurts.
0	@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
0	@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
0	@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
0	@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
2	@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
0	@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
2	@JetBlue here in Austin I saw the water bottles & snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! Im so Flight Booking Problems my next flight with you!

2	@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
1	@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down & is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
1	@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
1	@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
0	@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
0	@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
2	@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!

2	@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
2	@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
0	@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
1	@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day & price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
0	@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
0	@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
0	@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
0	@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO->JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...

0	@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
0	@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
0	@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
2	@JetBlue thanks
